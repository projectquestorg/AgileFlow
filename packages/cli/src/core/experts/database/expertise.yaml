# Database Expert - Mental Model
#
# This file represents the agent's understanding of database patterns.
# It is populated with AgileFlow-generic knowledge and learns project-specific
# details through the self-improve workflow.
#
# NOT a source of truth - always validate against actual code.

# Key files the database expert needs to know
files:
  schemas:
    - path: src/db/schema.ts
      purpose: Database table definitions (if using Drizzle/TypeORM)
      key_exports: [tables, relations]
    - path: prisma/schema.prisma
      purpose: Prisma schema file (if using Prisma)
      conventions: "model declarations with @id, @relation"
    - path: src/models/
      purpose: Model definitions (if using Mongoose/Sequelize)
      pattern: "<ModelName>.model.ts"

  migrations:
    - path: src/db/migrations/
      purpose: Schema migration scripts
      pattern: "YYYYMMDD_description.ts"
    - path: prisma/migrations/
      purpose: Prisma migration history
      conventions: "Auto-generated, don't edit"

  queries:
    - path: src/db/queries/
      purpose: Database query functions
      conventions: "One file per table/resource"
    - path: src/repositories/
      purpose: Repository pattern implementations
      pattern: "<Resource>Repository.ts"

  seeds:
    - path: src/db/seeds/
      purpose: Seed data for development/testing
      conventions: "Idempotent, can run multiple times"

  # AgileFlow-specific JSON data stores (not SQL databases)
  json_stores:
    - path: docs/09-agents/status.json
      purpose: "Story and epic tracking (AgileFlow's 'database')"
      schema:
        updated: "ISO timestamp"
        epics: "Map of EP-ID to {title, status, completed, summary}"
        stories: "Map of US-ID to {title, epic, owner, status, priority, estimate, depends_on, test_status}"
    - path: docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl
      purpose: "Agent coordination messages (append-only log)"
      format: "JSON Lines, one message per line"
    - path: docs/09-agents/archive/
      purpose: "Archived completed stories by month"
      pattern: "YYYY-MM.json"

# Common database relationships
# Self-improve will populate project-specific relationships
relationships:
  # AgileFlow JSON relationships
  - parent: epics
    child: stories
    type: one-to-many
    key: "stories[*].epic references epics[EP-ID]"
  - parent: stories
    child: test_cases
    type: one-to-one
    location: "docs/07-testing/test-cases/"

# Database patterns the expert should recognize and follow
patterns:
  # Generic SQL patterns (soft deletes, timestamps, UUID, FK/index naming) omitted - models know these

  - name: "JSON Single Source of Truth"
    description: "AgileFlow uses status.json as primary data store"
    location: docs/09-agents/status.json
    pattern: "Read-modify-write with updated timestamp"

  - name: "JSON Lines for Logs"
    description: "Append-only logs use .jsonl format"
    location: docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl
    pattern: "One JSON object per line, append only"

  - name: "Monthly Archival"
    description: "Completed stories archived by month to keep status.json lean"
    location: docs/09-agents/archive/YYYY-MM.json
    script: scripts/archive-completed-stories.sh

# Conventions (AgileFlow-specific only; generic SQL conventions omitted)
conventions:
  - "JSON stores: always update 'updated' timestamp when modifying"
  - "JSON Lines: append only, never modify existing lines"
  - "All queries use parameterized statements (prevent SQL injection)"
  - "Migrations must be reversible (up and down)"

# Learnings (trimmed - keep 2 most actionable)
learnings:
  - date: 2025-12-21
    context: "AgileFlow data storage"
    insight: "JSON files not SQL: status.json (epics EP-ID, stories US-ID with owner/status/priority/estimate/depends_on/test_status), log.jsonl (coordination), archive/ (historical)"

  - date: 2025-12-21
    context: "Archival pattern"
    insight: "archive-completed-stories.sh moves done stories >7 days to archive/YYYY-MM.json. Keeps status.json performant."
