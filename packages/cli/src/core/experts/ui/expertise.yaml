# UI Expert - Mental Model
#
# This file represents the agent's understanding of UI patterns.
# It is populated with AgileFlow-generic knowledge and learns project-specific
# details through the self-improve workflow.

# NOT a source of truth - always validate against actual code.

# Component registry
# Self-improve will populate project-specific components
relationships: []
  # Example - will be populated by self-improve:
  # - component: Button
  #   variants: [default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link]
  #   location: src/components/ui/button.tsx
  #   props: [variant, size, asChild]
  # - component: Card
  #   children: [CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent, CardFooter]
  #   location: src/components/ui/card.tsx

# UI patterns the expert should recognize and follow
patterns:
  - name: "Component composition"
    description: "Build complex UIs from small, focused components"
    location: All components
    principle: "Single responsibility per component"

  - name: "Props interface"
    description: "TypeScript interface for component props"
    location: Component file top
    convention: "interface ComponentNameProps"

  # Generic React patterns (forwardRef, Tailwind, CVA, a11y) omitted - models know these

  - name: "CLI Colored Output"
    description: "Use chalk for terminal colors with semantic meaning"
    location: packages/cli/tools/cli/lib/ui.js
    colors:
      - "green (success): ✓ messages"
      - "yellow (warning): ⚠ messages"
      - "red (error): ✗ messages"
      - "dim (info): informational text"
      - "#e8683a (brand): AgileFlow logo and headers"

  - name: "Interactive Prompts"
    description: "Use inquirer for multi-step CLI wizards"
    location: packages/cli/tools/cli/lib/ui.js
    types: [input, checkbox, confirm]

# Conventions the UI expert should follow
conventions:
  - "Components: PascalCase (Button, UserCard, NavMenu)"
  - "Files: Match component name or kebab-case"
  - "Props: interface <ComponentName>Props"
  - "Styling: Tailwind classes, avoid inline styles"
  - "Icons: Lucide React library (or project-specific)"
  - "State: useState for local, context/store for shared"
  - "Effects: useEffect with proper deps array"
  - "Accessibility: Always include aria-label for icons, role for custom elements"
  - "Testing: React Testing Library, test user interactions"
  - "CLI colors: chalk with semantic colors (green=success, red=error, yellow=warn)"
  - "CLI prompts: inquirer with validation functions"

# Learnings (trimmed - keep 2 most actionable)
learnings:
  - date: 2025-12-21
    context: "CLI UI patterns"
    insight: "chalk for colors (brand #e8683a, green=success, yellow=warning, red=error, dim=info). inquirer for prompts (input, checkbox, confirm)."

  - date: 2025-12-21
    context: "CLI logo and IDE choices"
    insight: "displayLogo() renders brand art with version. IDE_CHOICES array for checkbox prompts with name, value, checked, configDir."
