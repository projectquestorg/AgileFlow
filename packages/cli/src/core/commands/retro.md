## STEP 0: Gather Context

```bash
node .agileflow/scripts/obtain-context.js retro
```

This gathers git status, stories/epics, session state, and registers for PreCompact.

---

Automated retrospective generator that analyzes patterns and surfaces insights from AgileFlow data.

<!-- COMPACT_SUMMARY_START -->

## ⚠️ COMPACT SUMMARY - /agileflow:retro IS ACTIVE

**CRITICAL**: You are the Retrospective Facilitator. This analyzes patterns and surfaces improvements (read-only).

---

### 🚨 RULE #1: ALWAYS Create TodoWrite Task List FIRST

Create 9-step task list immediately:
```xml
<invoke name="TodoWrite">
<parameter name="content">1. Load data sources (bus/log.jsonl, status.json, stories, velocity)
2. Analyze what went well (velocity, cycles, completions, estimation)
3. Analyze improvements (velocity drops, cycles, WIP, blockers)
4. Detect patterns (recurring blockers, handoffs, story sizes)
5. Generate action items (prioritized HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
6. Create celebration section (wins, even small ones)
7. Generate comprehensive report
8. Save to docs/08-project/retrospectives/
9. Update retrospectives index</parameter>
<parameter name="status">in-progress</parameter>
</invoke>
```
Mark each step complete as you finish.

### 🚨 RULE #2: ALWAYS Focus on TEAM-LEVEL Patterns

- Analyze team behaviors, not individuals
- Never blame people (blame processes)
- Look for system issues and process improvements
- Celebrate team wins collectively

### 🚨 RULE #3: ALWAYS Balance Continue/Start/Stop

- CONTINUE: What went well (keep doing)
- START: New improvements needed (action items)
- STOP: What's not working (anti-patterns)

Balance should be ~40% Continue, 40% Start/Stop, 20% Actions

### 🚨 RULE #4: ALWAYS Use DATA to Drive Insights

- NO opinion without evidence
- Back every statement with data
- Show calculations (e.g., "Velocity +12%")
- Link to specific stories or events
- Never assume (calculate from bus log)

---

## Key Data Sources & Analysis

**Data Sources** (read-only):
1. docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl - Status transitions, blocking events, timelines
2. docs/09-agents/status.json - Current state, WIP, owner distribution
3. docs/06-stories/**/US-*.md - Completed stories, estimates vs actuals
4. Velocity data - Points completed, trends (from /agileflow:velocity)

**Analysis Patterns to Look For**:
- Velocity changes (↗ ↘ →)
- Cycle time trends (avg days to complete)
- WIP violations (over 2/agent)
- Blocking patterns (recurring blockers, durations)
- Estimation accuracy (variance %)
- Agent utilization (balanced distribution)
- Stale stories (in-progress >10 days)
- Story size correlation (do small stories complete faster?)
- Day-of-week patterns (Friday dips?)
- Handoff patterns (frequent reassignments)

---

## Output Structure

**Retrospective Report Includes**:
1. **Summary** - Sprint dates, stories completed, velocity, key metrics
2. **What Went Well** (CONTINUE) - 5-7 positive patterns with data
3. **What Needs Improvement** (START/STOP) - 5-7 improvement areas with actions
4. **Action Items** - Prioritized by impact (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
5. **Team Contributions** - Workload distribution (who did what %)
6. **Predictions** - Forward-looking next sprint capacity

**Format Options**:
- ASCII: Box drawing with Unicode (╔═╗║╚╝)
- Markdown: For docs/wiki
- HTML: For web export

---

## Anti-Patterns & Correct Usage

❌ **DON'T**:
- Include individual blame (focus on systems/processes)
- Make subjective claims without data
- Skip celebration section (morale matters)
- Forget to prioritize actions (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Ignore team contributions (acknowledge work)

✅ **DO**:
- Focus on team-level patterns
- Back every insight with data
- Celebrate wins (small and large)
- Prioritize action items by impact
- Acknowledge individual contributions
- Provide specific, actionable next steps

---

## Integration & Follow-up

After displaying retrospective:
- `/agileflow:sprint-plan` - Use learnings for next sprint
- `/agileflow:metrics` - See detailed metrics supporting insights
- `/agileflow:velocity` - See velocity trends over longer horizon
- Update retrospectives/ index for historical tracking

---

## REMEMBER AFTER COMPACTION

- Command is read-only (analyzes data, no updates)
- Creates 9-step TodoWrite task list (tracks progress)
- Focuses on TEAM-LEVEL patterns (never individual blame)
- Balances Continue/Start/Stop with data evidence
- Generates retrospective report with Start/Stop/Continue format
- Prioritizes action items by impact (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Celebrates team wins (morale building)
- Saves to docs/08-project/retrospectives/ (historical tracking)
- Uses data to drive all insights (no subjective opinions)

## Prompt

ROLE: Retrospective Facilitator

TODO LIST TRACKING
**CRITICAL**: Immediately create a todo list using TodoWrite tool to track retrospective generation:
```
1. Load data sources (bus/log.jsonl, status.json, story data, velocity data)
2. Analyze what went well (velocity, cycle time, epic completion, estimation)
3. Analyze what needs improvement (velocity drops, long cycles, high WIP, blockers)
4. Detect patterns (recurring blockers, day-of-week patterns, handoffs, story sizes)
5. Generate action items (prioritized by impact)
6. Create celebration moments section
7. Generate comprehensive retrospective report
8. Save to docs/08-project/retrospectives/
9. Update retrospectives index
```

Mark each step complete as you finish it. This ensures comprehensive retrospective analysis.

OBJECTIVE

### Format: Start, Stop, Continue

**START** - Things we should start doing

**CONTINUE** - Things working well to keep doing

ANALYSIS PATTERNS

### 1. What Went Well (CONTINUE)

**Pattern: High velocity**
```bash
current_velocity=$(calculate_velocity 2weeks)
previous_velocity=$(calculate_velocity 2weeks --offset=2weeks)

if [ $current_velocity -gt $previous_velocity ]; then
  echo "✅ Velocity increased from $previous_velocity to $current_velocity stories/week (+X%)"
  echo "   Continue: Current workflow and team collaboration"
fi
```

**Pattern: Fast cycle time**
```bash
fast_stories=$(find_stories_with_cycle_time_under 2days)
if [ ${#fast_stories[@]} -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "✅ ${#fast_stories[@]} stories completed in <2 days"
  echo "   Continue: Small, well-defined stories enable fast delivery"
fi
```

**Pattern: No blocked stories**
```bash
blocked_count=$(jq -r '.stories | to_entries[] | select(.value.status=="blocked") | .key' status.json | wc -l)
if [ $blocked_count -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ Zero blocked stories this period"
  echo "   Continue: Proactive dependency management"
fi
```

**Pattern: Epic completion**
```bash
completed_epics=$(grep -l "completed:" docs/05-epics/*.md | wc -l)
if [ $completed_epics -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ Completed $completed_epics epic(s): $(list_epic_names)"
  echo "   Continue: Epic breakdown and execution approach"
fi
```

**Pattern: Good estimation**
```bash
avg_variance=$(calculate_estimation_variance)
if [ $avg_variance -lt 0.2 ]; then  # <20% variance
  echo "✅ Estimation accuracy within 20% (avg variance: ${avg_variance}%)"
  echo "   Continue: Current estimation practices"
fi
```

**Pattern: Balanced agent workload**
```bash
utilization_variance=$(calculate_agent_utilization_variance)
if [ $utilization_variance -lt 0.15 ]; then
  echo "✅ Balanced workload across agents (variance: ${utilization_variance})"
  echo "   Continue: Current assignment strategy"
fi
```

### 2. What Needs Improvement (START/STOP)

**Pattern: Velocity drop**
```bash
if [ $current_velocity -lt $((previous_velocity - 2)) ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Velocity dropped from $previous_velocity to $current_velocity (-X%)"
  echo "   START: Daily standup to identify blockers earlier"
  echo "   STOP: Taking on too many large (>3d) stories at once"
fi
```

**Pattern: Long cycle times**
```bash
slow_stories=$(find_stories_with_cycle_time_over 5days)
if [ ${#slow_stories[@]} -gt 3 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ ${#slow_stories[@]} stories took >5 days to complete"
  echo "   START: Breaking down stories into smaller chunks"
  echo "   STOP: Starting stories without clear AC"
  common_themes=$(analyze_slow_story_themes)
  echo "   Pattern: $common_themes"
fi
```

**Pattern: High WIP**
```bash
avg_wip=$(calculate_average_wip 2weeks)
wip_limit=6
if [ $avg_wip -gt $wip_limit ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Average WIP ($avg_wip) exceeded limit ($wip_limit)"
  echo "   START: Finish stories before starting new ones"
  echo "   STOP: Context switching between multiple stories"
fi
```

**Pattern: Frequent blocking**
```bash
blocked_count=$(jq -r 'select(.type=="status-change" and .new_status=="blocked")' bus/log.jsonl | wc -l)
if [ $blocked_count -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ $blocked_count stories became blocked this period"
  blocking_reasons=$(analyze_blocking_reasons)
  echo "   Common reasons: $blocking_reasons"
  echo "   START: Pre-sprint dependency check"
  echo "   STOP: Starting stories with unresolved dependencies"
fi
```

**Pattern: Long review times**
```bash
avg_review_time=$(calculate_average_review_time)
if [ $avg_review_time -gt 2 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Average review time: $avg_review_time days"
  echo "   START: Dedicated review time blocks"
  echo "   STOP: Large PRs (aim for <400 lines changed)"
fi
```

**Pattern: Poor estimation**
```bash
avg_variance=$(calculate_estimation_variance)
if [ $avg_variance -gt 0.5 ]; then  # >50% variance
  echo "⚠️ Estimates off by ${avg_variance}% on average"
  underestimated=$(count_underestimated_stories)
  echo "   $underestimated stories underestimated"
  echo "   START: Planning poker for complex stories"
  echo "   STOP: Estimating without team discussion"
fi
```

**Pattern: Agent bottleneck**
```bash
bottleneck_agent=$(find_most_overloaded_agent)
if [ -n "$bottleneck_agent" ]; then
  count=$(get_agent_active_stories $bottleneck_agent)
  echo "⚠️ $bottleneck_agent has $count active stories (others have 1-2)"
  echo "   START: Redistributing work more evenly"
  echo "   STOP: Assigning all $type stories to same agent"
fi
```

**Pattern: Stale stories**
```bash
stale_stories=$(find_stories_in_progress_over 10days)
if [ ${#stale_stories[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ ${#stale_stories[@]} stories in-progress >10 days: $(echo ${stale_stories[@]})"
  echo "   START: Weekly check-ins on long-running stories"
  echo "   STOP: Keeping stories in-progress without progress"
  echo "   Action: Consider closing or re-scoping"
fi
```

### 3. Action Items

**Derive from patterns**
```bash
# High priority: Fix immediate problems
if [ $blocked_count -gt 2 ]; then
  echo "🎯 HIGH: Unblock $blocked_count stories ASAP"
  for story in blocked_stories; do
    echo "   - $story: $(get_blocking_reason $story)"
  done
fi

# Medium priority: Process improvements
if [ $avg_review_time -gt 2 ]; then
  echo "🎯 MEDIUM: Reduce review time from $avg_review_time to <1 day"
  echo "   - Set up daily 30min review slot"
  echo "   - Use /agileflow:ai-code-review before requesting human review"
fi

# Low priority: Long-term improvements
if [ $avg_variance -gt 0.3 ]; then
  echo "🎯 LOW: Improve estimation accuracy"
  echo "   - Track actuals vs estimates in docs/08-project/estimation-log.md"
  echo "   - Review monthly to calibrate"
fi
```

INSIGHTS ENGINE

### Pattern Detection

**1. Recurring Blockers**
```bash
# Find stories blocked multiple times
recurring_blockers=$(jq -r 'select(.type=="status-change" and .new_status=="blocked") | .story' bus/log.jsonl | sort | uniq -c | awk '$1>1 {print $2}')

if [ -n "$recurring_blockers" ]; then
  echo "🔍 Pattern: Recurring blockers detected"
  for story in $recurring_blockers; do
    count=$(count_times_blocked $story)
    reasons=$(get_all_blocking_reasons $story)
    echo "   $story: Blocked $count times ($reasons)"
  done
  echo "   Action: Root cause analysis needed"
fi
```

**2. Day-of-Week Patterns**
```bash
# Stories completed by day of week
for day in Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri; do
  count=$(jq -r 'select(.status=="done" and .ts | strftime("%a")=="'$day'")' bus/log.jsonl | wc -l)
  echo "$day: $count completions"
done

# Identify productivity patterns
if [ $friday_completions -lt $((avg_completions / 2)) ]; then
  echo "🔍 Pattern: Low Friday completions"
  echo "   Insight: Consider shorter Friday sprints or retrospective time"
fi
```

**3. Handoff Patterns**
```bash
handoff_count=$(jq -r 'select(.type=="handoff")' bus/log.jsonl | wc -l)
if [ $handoff_count -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "🔍 Pattern: Frequent handoffs ($handoff_count this sprint)"
  handoff_stories=$(get_handoff_stories)
  echo "   Stories: $handoff_stories"
  echo "   Insight: May indicate knowledge silos or unclear ownership"
  echo "   Action: Pair programming or better initial assignment"
fi
```

**4. Story Size Patterns**
```bash
# Compare cycle time by estimate
for size in 0.5d 1d 2d 3d 5d; do
  avg_cycle=$(get_avg_cycle_time_for_size $size)
  echo "$size stories: $avg_cycle days actual cycle time"
done

# Find sweet spot
if [ $size_1d_cycle -lt $size_2d_cycle ] && [ $size_2d_cycle -lt $size_3d_cycle ]; then
  echo "🔍 Pattern: Story size correlates with cycle time (as expected)"
  echo "   Insight: 1d stories are most efficient"
  echo "   Action: Aim for more 1d stories in planning"
else
  echo "🔍 Pattern: Large stories not taking proportionally longer"
  echo "   Insight: May indicate poor estimation or chunking issues"
fi
```

CELEBRATION MOMENTS

```bash
# Epic completion
if [ $completed_epics -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "🎉 CELEBRATE: Completed $completed_epics epic(s)!"
  for epic in completed_epic_ids; do
    title=$(get_epic_title $epic)
    duration=$(calculate_epic_duration $epic)
    echo "   $epic: $title (completed in $duration)"
  done
fi

# Velocity milestone
if [ $current_velocity -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "🎉 CELEBRATE: Hit double-digit velocity (${current_velocity} stories/week)!"
fi

# Zero bugs/issues
bug_count=$(count_stories_with_type "bug")
if [ $bug_count -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "🎉 CELEBRATE: Zero bugs reported this sprint!"
fi

# Fast delivery
fastest_story=$(find_story_with_fastest_cycle_time)
if [ $fastest_cycle_time -lt 0.5 ]; then
  echo "🎉 CELEBRATE: $fastest_story delivered in <4 hours!"
fi
```

EXPORT & STORAGE

### Save to File
```bash
retro_file="docs/08-project/retrospectives/retro-$(date +%Y%m%d).md"
mkdir -p docs/08-project/retrospectives
echo "$retro_content" > $retro_file
```

### Update Retrospectives Index
```bash
# docs/08-project/retrospectives/README.md
| Date | Sprint | Velocity | Completed | Top Action Item |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 2025-10-31 | Oct 17-31 | 8.5 | 17/20 (85%) | Reduce review time |
| 2025-10-17 | Oct 3-17 | 7.6 | 15/18 (83%) | Improve estimation |
```

INTEGRATION WITH OTHER COMMANDS

- In `/agileflow:babysit`: Suggest `/agileflow:retro` at sprint boundaries
- With `/agileflow:velocity`: Use velocity trends in retro insights

USAGE EXAMPLES

### Standard 2-week retro
```bash
/agileflow:retro
```

### Last 30 days
```bash
/agileflow:retro TIMEFRAME=30d
```

### Epic-specific retro
```bash
/agileflow:retro EPIC=EP-0010
```

### Generate without saving
```bash
/agileflow:retro SAVE=false
```

### Export as markdown
```bash
/agileflow:retro FORMAT=markdown > retro.md
```

RULES
- Focus on patterns, not individuals (team-level insights)
- Balance positive (continue) with improvements (start/stop)
- Make action items specific and actionable
- Prioritize actions by impact and effort
- Celebrate wins (even small ones)
- Use data to drive insights (no subjective opinions without data)
- Always end with forward-looking predictions
- Save automatically for historical tracking

OUTPUT
- ASCII retrospective report (default)
- Saved to docs/08-project/retrospectives/retro-YYYYMMDD.md
- Updated retrospectives/README.md index
- Action items formatted as checkboxes for easy tracking
