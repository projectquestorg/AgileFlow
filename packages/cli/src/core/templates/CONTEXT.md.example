# Project Context

This file is loaded at session start by AgileFlow's context-loader hook.
It provides project-specific context that Claude should be aware of.

## How to Use

1. Copy this file to `CONTEXT.md` in your project root
2. Edit the sections below with your project details
3. The context will be loaded automatically at each session start

**Size Guidelines:**
- Recommended: <10KB (focused, essential info)
- Maximum: 50KB (will be truncated if larger)
