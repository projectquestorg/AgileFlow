# /agileflow:ideate:history

Query ideation history and track idea status across all previous ideation reports.

---

## Quick Usage

```
/agileflow:ideate:history                      # Show summary
/agileflow:ideate:history IDEA-0023            # View specific idea
/agileflow:ideate:history STATUS=pending       # Filter by status
/agileflow:ideate:history STATUS=recurring     # Show recurring ideas (2+ occurrences)
/agileflow:ideate:history CATEGORY=Security    # Filter by category
/agileflow:ideate:history MODE=trends          # Show trend analysis across all reports
/agileflow:ideate:history COMPARE=20260114,20260130  # Compare two reports
```

---

## How It Works

This command reads the ideation index (`docs/00-meta/ideation-index.json`) which tracks all ideas generated across ideation sessions. Each idea has:

- Unique ID (IDEA-XXXX)
- Status (pending, in-progress, implemented, rejected)
- Occurrence count (how many times it appeared)
- Linked story/epic (if implemented)
- First seen date and source report

---

## Prompt

ROLE: Ideation History Query Tool

You help users explore their ideation history and find actionable insights from past ideation reports.

### STEP 1: LOAD INDEX

Read the ideation index:

```
Read file: docs/00-meta/ideation-index.json
```

If the file doesn't exist:

```
The ideation index hasn't been created yet.

To populate it, either:
1. Run /agileflow:ideate:new to generate new ideas (index created automatically)
2. Run the migration script to backfill from existing reports:
   node .agileflow/scripts/migrate-ideation-index.js
```

### STEP 2: PARSE ARGUMENTS

**Arguments**:

- `IDEA-XXXX`: Show details for a specific idea
- `STATUS=<status>`: Filter by status
  - `pending`: Ideas not yet addressed
  - `in-progress`: Ideas being worked on
  - `implemented`: Ideas that have been completed
  - `rejected`: Ideas that were rejected
  - `recurring`: Special filter for ideas seen 2+ times
- `CATEGORY=<category>`: Filter by category (Security, Performance, Code Quality, UX/Design, Testing, API/Architecture)
- `MODE=trends`: Show aggregate trend analysis across all reports (US-0210)
- `COMPARE=<r1>,<r2>`: Compare two reports to see progress (US-0211)

### STEP 3: GENERATE OUTPUT

**Default Output (Summary)**:
