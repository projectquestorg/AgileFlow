# Dashboard

The AgileFlow Dashboard is a real-time web application that provides a visual interface for managing your AI-assisted development workflow. It connects to the AgileFlow CLI via WebSocket and displays live updates as Claude works on your project.

## Key Features

- **Live Chat** - Send messages to Claude and see streaming responses with tool call visualization
- **Git Review** - View file changes, diffs, stage/unstage files, and commit directly from the UI
- **Integrated Terminal** - Spawn terminal sessions within the dashboard
- **Automation Management** - View, run, and monitor automated tasks
- **Notification System** - Browser notifications for important events
- **Multi-Session Support** - Switch between parallel development sessions
- **Project Status** - Real-time story and epic progress tracking
- **Team Metrics** - Real-time visibility into per-agent and per-gate performance across your AI team

## Architecture

The dashboard consists of two parts:

1. **Dashboard Server** (`agileflow serve`) - A WebSocket server that runs alongside your CLI, providing real-time data
2. **Dashboard App** - A Next.js web application that connects to the server

Communication happens over WebSocket with a structured message protocol supporting streaming text, tool calls, git operations, terminal I/O, and more.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the dashboard server (automatically creates tunnel for remote access)
agileflow serve

# Copy the provided WebSocket URL and open the AgileFlow Dashboard
# A tunnel URL will be displayed: wss://xxx.trycloudflare.com

# Or for local-only access, disable the tunnel
agileflow serve --no-tunnel
# Then connect to ws://localhost:8765
```

See [Setup Guide](/docs/dashboard/setup) for detailed instructions.
