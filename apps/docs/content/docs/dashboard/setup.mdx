# Dashboard Setup

## Prerequisites

- AgileFlow CLI installed (`npm install -g agileflow`)
- An AgileFlow project (run `npx agileflow setup` in your project)
- Node.js >= 18

## Starting the Server

Start the dashboard WebSocket server from your project directory:

```bash
agileflow serve
```

Or use the slash command within Claude Code:

```
/agileflow:serve
```

The server starts on port `8765` by default and automatically creates a tunnel for remote access.

### Server Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--port` | `8765` | WebSocket server port |
| `--host` | `0.0.0.0` | Server host (listens on all interfaces) |
| `--api-key` | none | Optional API key for authentication |
| `--require-auth` | `false` | Require API key for all connections |
| `--no-tunnel` | `false` | Disable automatic tunnel (local only) |
| `--tunnel-provider` | `cloudflared` | Tunnel provider: `cloudflared` or `ngrok` |

## Connecting the Dashboard

By default, the serve command creates an automatic tunnel (cloudflared) for remote access:

1. Run `agileflow serve`
2. Copy the provided tunnel URL (looks like `wss://xxx.trycloudflare.com`)
3. Open the AgileFlow Dashboard at https://dashboard.agileflow.projectquestorg.com
4. Paste the URL into the WebSocket connection field
5. Click **Connect**

### Local Connection

For local-only access, disable the tunnel:

```bash
agileflow serve --no-tunnel
```

Then connect to `ws://localhost:8765` from your local machine.

Once connected, the dashboard will automatically receive:
- Current git status
- Active automations
- Inbox items
- Project status updates
- Real-time team metrics (per-agent and per-gate)

## Authentication

The server listens on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) by default but uses tunnels (cloudflared or ngrok) for secure remote access. To add authentication:

```bash
agileflow serve --api-key your-secret-key
```

With `--api-key` set, the dashboard must provide the API key in the connection dialog. Use `--require-auth` to enforce authentication:

```bash
agileflow serve --api-key your-secret-key --require-auth
```

## Tunnel Configuration

The server automatically starts a tunnel by default for remote access:

**Cloudflared (default):**
```bash
agileflow serve
```
Creates a secure tunnel via cloudflare.com, no installation needed.

**ngrok (alternative):**
```bash
agileflow serve --tunnel-provider ngrok
```
Requires ngrok to be installed and configured.

**Disable tunnel (local only):**
```bash
agileflow serve --no-tunnel
```
Only allows connections from your local machine.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed
- Verify the server is running and check the URL it reports
- If using tunnel, ensure the provided URL is correct
- For local connections, verify the port is not in use: `lsof -i :8765`
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors

### No Data Appearing
- Click the refresh button in the dashboard to request updated status
- Verify your project has a `docs/09-agents/status.json` file
- Check the server console for error messages
- Enable debug mode: `DEBUG=* agileflow serve`

### Tunnel Issues
- For cloudflared: ensure internet connection is stable
- For ngrok: verify your account is connected (`ngrok config`)
- If tunnel keeps disconnecting, try `--no-tunnel` for local development
