# Dashboard Setup

## Prerequisites

- AgileFlow CLI installed (`npm install -g agileflow`)
- An AgileFlow project (run `npx agileflow setup` in your project)
- Node.js >= 18

## Starting the Server

Start the dashboard WebSocket server from your project directory:

```bash
agileflow serve
```

Or use the slash command within Claude Code:

```
/agileflow:serve
```

The server starts on `ws://localhost:8765` by default.

### Server Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--port` | `8765` | WebSocket server port |
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Server host (localhost only for security) |

## Connecting the Dashboard

1. Open the dashboard application in your browser
2. Enter the WebSocket URL (default: `ws://localhost:8765`)
3. Click **Connect**

Once connected, the dashboard will automatically receive:
- Current git status
- Active automations
- Inbox items
- Project status updates

## Authentication

For security, the dashboard server binds to localhost by default. If you need remote access, configure an API key:

```bash
agileflow serve --api-key your-secret-key
```

Then enter the API key in the dashboard connection dialog.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed
- Verify the server is running: check for `[Dashboard Server] Listening on ws://127.0.0.1:8765`
- Ensure the port is not in use by another process
- Check firewall settings if connecting remotely

### No Data Appearing
- Click the refresh button to request updated status
- Check the browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify your project has a `docs/09-agents/status.json` file
