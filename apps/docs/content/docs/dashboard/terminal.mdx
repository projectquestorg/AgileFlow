# Integrated Terminal

The dashboard includes an embedded terminal panel for running commands without leaving the interface.

## Opening the Terminal

- Click the **Terminal** button in the footer bar
- Or press **Cmd+J** (Mac) / **Ctrl+J** (Windows/Linux)

## Spawning a Session

Click **New Terminal** to spawn a terminal process on the server. The terminal runs in the project directory with a clean environment (sensitive environment variables are stripped for security).

## Input and Output

- Type commands directly in the terminal
- Output streams in real-time via WebSocket
- ANSI color codes are rendered for colored output

## Resizing

The terminal automatically resizes when the panel dimensions change. The server is notified of the new dimensions to ensure proper text wrapping.

## Closing

Click the **X** button or use `exit` to close a terminal session. The server process is terminated and cleaned up.
