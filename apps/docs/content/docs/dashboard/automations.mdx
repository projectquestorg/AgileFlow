# Automations

The automations panel in the sidebar shows all configured AgileFlow automations and their status.

## Viewing Automations

Each automation displays:

- **Name** and description
- **Schedule** (daily, weekly, monthly, interval, or on-session)
- **Status** indicator (idle, running, error, disabled)
- **Next run** time
- **Last run** result

## Schedule Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `daily` | Runs once per day | Daily at 9:00 |
| `weekly` | Runs once per week | Weekly on Monday |
| `monthly` | Runs once per month | Monthly on the 1st |
| `interval` | Runs at fixed intervals | Every 24 hours |
| `on_session` | Runs when session starts | On each session |

## Running Automations

Click the **play** button on an automation to run it manually. While running:

- A spinning indicator shows it's in progress
- The **stop** button becomes available to cancel

## Automation Results

When an automation completes, its result is added to the **Inbox**. Results include:

- Success/failure status
- Output text
- Error details (if failed)
- Execution duration

## Configuring Automations

Automations are configured in your AgileFlow project settings. See the [Hooks System](/docs/features/hooks-system) documentation for setup details.
