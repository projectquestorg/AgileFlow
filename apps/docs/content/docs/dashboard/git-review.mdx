# Git Review Panel

The right-side review panel provides a complete git workflow within the dashboard.

## File Change List

Files are displayed with:

- **Status indicator** (A=added, M=modified, D=deleted, ?=untracked)
- **File path** with directory in muted color and filename highlighted
- **Addition/deletion counts** when available
- **Color coding** based on change type

### Filtering

Use the tab bar to filter files:

- **Staged** - Files ready to commit
- **Unstaged** - Modified files not yet staged
- **All** - Both staged and unstaged

## Diff Viewer

Click a file to view its diff. The diff viewer shows:

- **Unified diff** with line numbers (old and new)
- **Syntax highlighting** for additions (green) and deletions (red)
- **Hunk navigation** with collapsible sections
- **Copy button** to copy the raw diff

## Staging and Unstaging

- Click the **+** button on an unstaged file to stage it
- Click the **-** button on a staged file to unstage it
- Use **+all** / **-all** buttons to stage or unstage everything
- Per-hunk staging is available in the diff viewer

## Reverting Changes

Click the **revert** icon on an unstaged file to discard changes. This runs `git checkout -- <file>`.

> **Warning**: Reverting is destructive and cannot be undone.

## Committing

1. Stage the files you want to commit
2. Click the **Commit** button at the bottom of the review panel
3. Enter a commit message in the dialog
4. Click **Commit** to create the commit

To push your commits, use the integrated terminal or run git commands locally.

## Opening Files in Editor

Click on a filename to open it in your default editor. Line numbers in the diff viewer are also clickable - clicking jumps directly to that line.

Supported editors are detected automatically:
- VS Code (`code`)
- Cursor (`cursor`)
- Windsurf (`windsurf`)
- Sublime Text (`subl`)
