# Notifications

The dashboard supports browser notifications to keep you informed of important events.

## Notification Types

- **Info** - General information (session created, operation complete)
- **Success** - Successful operations (commit created, automation passed)
- **Warning** - Potential issues (rate limited, connection unstable)
- **Error** - Failures (git error, connection lost)

## Notification Modes

Configure when notifications appear via the settings panel (click the bell icon):

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Background** | Only notify when the dashboard tab is not focused |
| **Always** | Notify on all events regardless of focus |
| **Never** | Disable all notifications |

## Browser Permissions

The dashboard requests browser notification permission on first use. You can manage this in your browser's site settings.

## Unread Badge

The bell icon in the header shows an unread count badge when there are unseen notifications.
