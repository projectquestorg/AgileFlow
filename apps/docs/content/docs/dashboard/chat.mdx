# Chat Interface

The chat panel is the primary way to interact with Claude through the dashboard.

## Sending Messages

Type your message in the input field at the bottom and press **Enter** or click **Send**. Messages are forwarded to Claude via the WebSocket connection.

### Slash Commands

You can use AgileFlow slash commands directly in the chat:

```
/agileflow:status
/agileflow:plan
/agileflow:commit
```

## Response Streaming

Claude's responses stream in real-time via `text_delta` messages. You'll see text appear character by character as it's generated.

## Tool Call Visualization

When Claude uses tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.), the dashboard shows:

- **Tool name** and input parameters
- **Spinning indicator** while the tool runs
- **Result** or error when complete
- Tool calls are nested within the assistant message that triggered them

## Question Dialogs

When Claude uses the `AskUserQuestion` tool, a dialog appears with:

- The question text
- Available options as buttons
- Multi-select support when applicable
- Option to dismiss (skip the question)

## Image Upload

Click the image icon in the chat input to upload an image. Supported formats:

- PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP

The image is sent as base64-encoded data alongside your message.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Enter` | Send message |
