# Dead Route Analyzer

The Completeness Analyzer: Dead Routes agent is a specialized analyzer focused on **dead navigation and broken links**. It finds placeholder hrefs (`#`), links pointing to routes that don't exist, orphaned navigation items, and dead internal links that would result in 404 errors.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to find broken internal navigation links
- You want to identify placeholder `#` hrefs that were never filled in
- You're looking for orphaned nav items pointing to missing pages
- You need to verify all routes have corresponding page components
- You're auditing link integrity before a release

## How It Works

1. **Scans navigation** - Finds all `<a>`, `<Link>`, and router navigation calls
2. **Maps routes** - Builds a map of all defined routes in the application
3. **Cross-references** - Checks every link target against the route map
4. **Identifies placeholders** - Finds `href="#"`, `href=""`, and `href="javascript:void(0)"`
5. **Finds orphaned items** - Navigation entries pointing to undefined routes
6. **Reports findings** - Lists broken links with location and suggested fixes

## Focus Areas

- **Placeholder hrefs**: `href="#"`, `href=""`, `href="javascript:void(0)"` in production
- **Missing route targets**: Links to `/dashboard` when no `/dashboard` route exists
- **Orphaned nav items**: Sidebar or menu entries pointing to dead pages
- **Dead internal links**: `<Link to="/old-page">` where the page was removed
- **Route-component mismatches**: Route defined but component returns null or placeholder

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep

## Example Analysis

Given navigation with dead links:
```jsx
// Navigation component with broken links
<nav>
  <Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>        {/* Route exists */}
  <Link to="/settings">Settings</Link>          {/* Route exists */}
  <Link to="/analytics">Analytics</Link>        {/* NO ROUTE - 404 */}
  <a href="#">Reports</a>                       {/* Placeholder */}
  <Link to="/admin/users">User Management</Link> {/* NO ROUTE - 404 */}
</nav>

// Router definition
<Routes>
  <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path="/settings" element={<Settings />} />
  {/* No /analytics route */}
  {/* No /admin/users route */}
</Routes>
```

The Dead Route analyzer would identify:

- **BROKEN**: Link to `/analytics` has no matching route (404 for users)
- **BROKEN**: Link to `/admin/users` has no matching route (404 for users)
- **PLACEHOLDER**: `href="#"` on Reports link (user clicks, nothing happens)

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Find broken navigation links",
  prompt: "Scan src/components/ and src/pages/ for dead navigation links, placeholder hrefs, and routes pointing to missing pages.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-completeness-analyzer-routes"
)
```
