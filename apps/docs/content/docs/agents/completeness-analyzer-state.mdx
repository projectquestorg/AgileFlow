# Unused State Analyzer

The Completeness Analyzer: Unused State agent is a specialized analyzer focused on **dead state declarations and unused context**. It finds React hooks (useState, useReducer) that are declared but never read, orphaned context providers that no component consumes, and dead Redux/Zustand store slices.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to find useState declarations never used in render
- You want to identify useReducer hooks never dispatched
- You're looking for orphaned context providers
- You need to find dead Redux or Zustand store slices
- You're cleaning up unused state management code

## How It Works

1. **Scans state declarations** - Finds all useState, useReducer, useContext calls
2. **Tracks reads** - Maps where state values are actually read in render
3. **Tracks writes** - Maps where setState/dispatch is called
4. **Identifies unused** - Finds state declared but never read or written
5. **Checks contexts** - Verifies context providers are actually consumed
6. **Analyzes stores** - Checks Redux/Zustand slices for actual selector usage
7. **Reports findings** - Lists dead state with context and removal suggestions

## Focus Areas

- **useState never read**: `const [value, setValue] = useState()` where `value` is never referenced
- **useReducer never dispatched**: Reducer hooks with no dispatch calls anywhere
- **Orphaned context providers**: Contexts created but no components consume them
- **Dead store slices**: Redux/Zustand slices with no selectors or dispatches
- **Unused setters**: State setters declared but never called

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep

## Example Analysis

Given React code with unused state:
```jsx
export function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);    // Never read
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');       // Never used

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser(userId).then(setUser);
  }, [userId]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user?.name}</h1>
      {/* loading and theme are never referenced */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The Unused State analyzer would identify:

- **INCOMPLETE**: `loading` state declared but never read in render or conditionals
- **DORMANT**: `theme` state declared, initialized, but never read or updated

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Find unused React state and context",
  prompt: "Scan src/components/ for unused useState, useReducer, useContext, and orphaned context providers. Check src/store/ for unused Redux/Zustand slices.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-completeness-analyzer-state"
)
```
