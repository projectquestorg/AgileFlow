# Legal Analyzer - Content & IP

The Legal Analyzer - Content agent (AG-LEGAL-CONTENT) is a compliance specialist who identifies content moderation obligations and intellectual property compliance gaps. This agent analyzes platforms that host user-generated content, embed third-party content, or handle copyrighted material for legal risks.

## Capabilities

- **DMCA Compliance**: Verify Digital Millennium Copyright Act safe harbor requirements
- **UGC Platform Obligations**: Identify content moderation requirements for user content
- **Digital Services Act**: Assess EU DSA transparency and moderation obligations
- **Copyright Risk**: Detect unauthorized use of copyrighted material
- **Content Licensing**: Verify media assets are properly licensed
- **Takedown Procedures**: Evaluate DMCA takedown and counter-notice processes
- **User Rights**: Verify content ownership and licensing terms in user agreements
- **Safe Harbor Protection**: Ensure platform qualifies for intermediary liability protection

- Using stock photos, fonts, or media assets
- Implementing content moderation systems
- Need DMCA safe harbor compliance
- Operating in the EU (Digital Services Act)
- Handling copyright complaints or takedown requests
- Scraping or aggregating content from other sources

## How It Works

1. **Platform Assessment**: Agent determines if application hosts user-generated content
2. **Content Flow Analysis**: Agent maps how content enters, is stored, and is displayed
3. **DMCA Audit**: Agent verifies safe harbor requirements (designated agent, takedown process)
4. **Moderation Review**: Agent evaluates content moderation capabilities
5. **Asset Audit**: Agent checks embedded media for licensing compliance
6. **Compliance Mapping**: Agent maps gaps to DMCA, DSA, and copyright law

## Example

```bash
# Via legal audit - content compliance check
/agileflow:legal:audit app/ FOCUS=content

# Agent output:
# Content & IP Compliance Audit
#
# Platform Type: Social media with user uploads
# UGC Features: Image uploads, comments, profiles
# Risk Level: HIGH
#
# CRITICAL FINDINGS:
# 1. No DMCA designated agent registered
#    Issue: Platform accepts uploads but no DMCA agent filed
#    Risk: Lose safe harbor protection for ALL user content
#    Fix: Register DMCA agent with Copyright Office ($6 filing fee)
#
# 2. No content takedown procedure
#    Issue: No mechanism to handle copyright complaints
#    Risk: Platform liable for infringing user uploads
#    Fix: Implement takedown request form and process (8 hours)
#
# HIGH FINDINGS:
# 3. User TOS doesn't address content licensing
# 4. No content moderation for illegal material
# 5. Stock images used without license documentation
```

## Key Behaviors

- **Safe Harbor Priority**: Ensure platforms maintain DMCA safe harbor eligibility
