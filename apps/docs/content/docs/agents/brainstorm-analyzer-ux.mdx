# UX Improvements

The Brainstorm Analyzer: UX Improvements agent is a specialized UX analyzer focused on **identifying user experience improvements the app should have**. It analyzes the UI code and finds missing UX patterns, feedback gaps, accessibility issues, and interaction improvements that would make the app feel more polished and user-friendly.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to identify missing feedback states (loading, error, success)
- You want to find navigation gaps and information hierarchy issues
- You're looking for missing interactions (keyboard shortcuts, drag-and-drop, undo)
- You need to assess accessibility gaps (ARIA labels, focus management, contrast)
- You want to find missing responsive design patterns
- You're checking for missing user guidance (onboarding, tooltips, help text)

## How It Works

1. **Understands UI stack** - Identifies the UI framework and component libraries used
2. **Analyzes UX patterns** - Finds missing feedback states, empty states, confirmations, keyboard support, responsive design, accessibility
3. **Assesses user impact** - Describes what users FEEL, not just code issues
4. **Suggests specific improvements** - Recommends concrete UX enhancements with implementation hints

## Focus Areas

- **Missing feedback states**: No loading spinners, no success/error toasts, no empty states
- **Navigation gaps**: No breadcrumbs, no back buttons, no clear information hierarchy
- **Missing interactions**: No keyboard shortcuts, no drag-and-drop where expected, no undo
- **Accessibility gaps**: Missing ARIA labels, no skip links, poor color contrast, no focus management
- **Missing responsive patterns**: No mobile layout, no touch targets, no responsive navigation
- **Missing user guidance**: No onboarding, no tooltips, no help text, no empty state guidance

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep

## Output Format

For each UX improvement found, the agent provides:
- **Location**: File, component name, or page where issue exists
- **Category**: FEEDBACK_GAP, EMPTY_STATE, NAVIGATION, INTERACTION, ACCESSIBILITY, RESPONSIVE, or GUIDANCE
- **Value**: HIGH_VALUE, MEDIUM_VALUE, or NICE_TO_HAVE
- **Effort**: SMALL (hours), MEDIUM (days), or LARGE (weeks)
- **Current Experience**: What users see/feel today
- **Suggested Improvement**: What should be added
- **User Impact**: Specific frustration or confusion, how experience improves
- **Implementation Hint**: Specific approach (e.g., component recommendation, pattern)

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Audit UX improvements needed in React application",
  prompt: "Review the UI code for missing feedback states, accessibility issues, navigation gaps, and interaction patterns. Identify all UX improvements that would make the app feel more polished and user-friendly.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-brainstorm-analyzer-ux"
)
```
