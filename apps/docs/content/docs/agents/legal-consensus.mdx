# Consensus Coordinator

The Legal Consensus Coordinator (AG-LEGAL-CONSENSUS) collects findings from all legal analyzers, validates them against the project type, votes on confidence, and produces the final prioritized Legal Risk Report.

## Capabilities

- **Project Type Detection**: Automatically determine if project is SaaS, e-commerce, healthcare, etc.
- **Finding Collection**: Parse and normalize outputs from all 9 legal analyzers
- **Relevance Filtering**: Exclude findings irrelevant to the detected project type
- **Confidence Voting**: Score findings based on multi-analyzer agreement
- **Conflict Resolution**: When analyzers disagree, investigate and decide
- **Report Generation**: Produce prioritized, actionable Legal Risk Report
- **Remediation Checklist**: Generate step-by-step fix list with effort estimates
- **False Positive Elimination**: Filter out findings that don't apply to the project context

## When to Use

The Legal Consensus Coordinator is automatically invoked by the `/legal:audit` command after all analyzers complete. You typically don't invoke it directly.

## How It Works

1. **Detect Project Type**: Reads codebase to determine application type (SaaS, e-commerce, etc.)
2. **Collect Findings**: Parses all analyzer outputs into normalized structure
3. **Filter by Relevance**: Excludes findings irrelevant to the detected project type
4. **Vote on Confidence**: Multiple analyzers flagging same issue = higher confidence
5. **Resolve Conflicts**: When analyzers disagree, investigates and decides
6. **Generate Report**: Produces prioritized, actionable Legal Risk Report

### Confidence Scoring

| Confidence | Criteria | Priority |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **CONFIRMED** | 2+ analyzers independently identified the same issue | High - fix immediately |
| **LIKELY** | 1 analyzer with strong evidence (specific code location, clear regulation) | Medium - fix this sprint |
| **INVESTIGATE** | 1 analyzer with circumstantial evidence | Low - verify manually |

### Project Type Filtering

The consensus coordinator adjusts findings based on detected project type:

| Project Type | Key Indicators | Most Relevant Analyzers |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **SaaS** | Subscription billing, user accounts | Privacy, Terms, Security, AI |
| **E-commerce** | Shopping cart, checkout, products | Consumer, Terms, Privacy, Security |
| **Healthcare** | Patient data, HIPAA references | Privacy, Security, Terms, A11y |
| **Social/UGC** | User posts, uploads, profiles | Content, Privacy, Consumer, A11y |
| **Static/Blog** | No user data, informational | A11y, Licensing |
| **AI/ML App** | AI API calls, model inference | AI, Privacy, Terms, Consumer |

## Example Output

```
LEGAL RISK REPORT
Generated: 2026-02-14
Project Type: SaaS Application (detected)

RISK SUMMARY
| Risk Level | Count |
|------------|-------|
| Critical   | 2     |
| High       | 3     |
| Medium     | 4     |
| Low        | 1     |

Total: 10 findings (3 false positives excluded)

FIX BEFORE LAUNCH (Critical)
1. [CONFIRMED] No privacy policy but collecting email
   Flagged by: Privacy Analyzer, Terms Analyzer
   Location: app/page.tsx:42
   Legal Basis: GDPR Art. 13, CCPA 1798.130
   Remediation: Create /privacy page, link from footer

2. [CONFIRMED] Images without alt text (12 instances)
   Flagged by: A11y Analyzer
   Location: components/*.tsx
   Legal Basis: ADA Title III, WCAG 2.1 AA
   Remediation: Add descriptive alt attributes

FALSE POSITIVES EXCLUDED:
- PIPL data localization (no Chinese users detected)
- DMCA designated agent (no user-uploaded content)
- PCI-DSS encryption (no payment processing)
```

## Key Behaviors

- **Context Sensitivity**: Filters findings based on what the project actually does
- **Multi-Analyzer Agreement**: Higher confidence when multiple analyzers agree
- **False Positive Reduction**: Actively removes irrelevant findings to reduce noise
- **Actionable Output**: Every finding includes specific remediation steps
- **Priority Ordering**: Report organized by fix urgency (critical first)
- **Effort Estimates**: Include approximate time to remediate each finding

## Tools Available

- Read, Write, Edit (file operations for report generation)
- Glob, Grep (search for project type indicators)
