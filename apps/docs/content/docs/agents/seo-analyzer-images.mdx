# Image Optimization

The Image Optimization agent is a specialized SEO analyzer focused on **image optimization for SEO and performance**. It evaluates images on web pages for alt text quality, sizing attributes, modern formats, lazy loading, Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) optimization, and file size efficiency.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to audit images for SEO best practices
- You're optimizing images for Core Web Vitals (CLS, LCP)
- You want to improve image alt text for accessibility and search
- You're checking for Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) caused by unsized images
- You need to modernize image formats (WebP/AVIF adoption)

## How It Works

1. **Fetches the target page** - Extracts all `<img>` elements, CSS background images, `<picture>` elements
2. **Audits Alt Text** - Evaluates descriptiveness, length (10-125 chars), relevance, and flags missing alt text
3. **Checks Image Sizing** - Verifies width/height attributes present to prevent layout shift
4. **Analyzes Image Formats** - Identifies modern formats (WebP/AVIF) vs legacy (JPEG/PNG/GIF)
5. **Assesses Lazy Loading** - Checks if below-fold images use `loading="lazy"` for performance
6. **Verifies LCP Optimization** - Ensures hero/above-fold images have `fetchpriority="high"`
7. **Reviews Responsive Images** - Checks for `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for device adaptation

## Focus Areas

- **Alt Text Quality**: Descriptive, contextually relevant, natural keywords, 10-125 characters
- **Image Sizing**: Explicit width/height attributes to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- **Modern Formats**: WebP and AVIF adoption vs legacy PNG/JPEG only
- **Lazy Loading**: Below-fold images using `loading="lazy"` to defer loading
- **LCP Optimization**: Hero image priority with `fetchpriority="high"`
- **File Size**: Oversized images impacting page load time
- **Responsive Images**: `srcset` and `sizes` for responsive delivery across devices

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch

## Alt Text Quality Levels

| Quality | Criteria | Examples |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Good | Descriptive, 10-125 chars, contextually relevant | "Woman typing on laptop at desk" |
| Acceptable | Present but generic | "image", "photo" |
| Poor | Filename-based | "IMG_001.jpg", "screenshot-2024-01-15" |
| Missing | No alt attribute | ❌ |
| Decorative | Empty alt="" | Correct for purely decorative images |
| Keyword-stuffed | Excessive keywords crammed in | ❌ |

## Scoring Guide

| Aspect | Weight | Scoring |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Alt text quality | 30% | -3 per missing, -2 per poor quality |
| Sizing (CLS) | 20% | -3 per image without width/height |
| Modern formats | 15% | -2 per legacy-only image |
| Lazy loading | 15% | -2 per below-fold image without lazy |
| LCP optimization | 10% | -10 if LCP image missing priority |
| Responsive images | 10% | -2 per large image without srcset |

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Analyze image optimization",
  prompt: "Audit all images on https://example.com for SEO and performance. Check alt text, sizing, formats, lazy loading, and LCP optimization.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-seo-analyzer-images"
)
```

## Output Format

```markdown
FINDING-1: Missing alt text on hero image

Category: Alt Text
URL: https://example.com
Image: /images/hero.jpg
Severity: CRITICAL
Confidence: HIGH

Issue: Hero image has no alt attribute, missing accessibility and search optimization.

Current:
<img src="hero.jpg">

Remediation:
<img src="hero.jpg" alt="Professional team collaborating in modern office">
```

## Important Rules

1. **Fetch actual page** - Use WebFetch to see real image tags, don't guess
2. **Don't penalize decorative images** - Empty `alt=""` is correct for purely decorative images
3. **Prioritize by impact** - Large hero images matter more than tiny icons
4. **Consider context** - Alt text should match the page's content context
5. **Estimate above/below fold** - First 2-3 images are likely above-fold

## Common Issues Found

- Missing alt text on images
- Filename-based alt text (IMG_001.jpg)
- Missing width/height causing CLS
- Only legacy formats (JPEG/PNG) without WebP/AVIF
- Missing lazy loading on below-fold images
- Hero image lacking fetchpriority="high"
- Images without responsive srcset on image-heavy pages
