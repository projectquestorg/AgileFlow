# Feature Gaps

The Brainstorm Analyzer: Feature Gaps agent is a specialized feature analyzer focused on **identifying missing features and incomplete user workflows**. It analyzes the app's existing code to find features it SHOULD have but doesn't — not code quality issues, but product-level gaps.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to identify missing CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- You want to find half-built features (UI without backend, or vice versa)
- You're looking for missing common patterns (search, pagination, filtering)
- You need to detect incomplete user workflows
- You want to find missing data features (export, import, backup, history)
- You're checking for absent admin/settings features

## How It Works

1. **Understands the app** - Analyzes project structure to determine app type, domain, core entities, routes, and pages
2. **Maps existing features** - Builds a mental model of what CRUD operations and user flows exist
3. **Identifies gaps** - Finds incomplete CRUD, UI without backend, missing common patterns, dead-end workflows, missing data features
4. **Reports findings** - Generates structured findings with locations, categories, value assessments, and user impact

## Focus Areas

- **Missing CRUD operations**: App has create but not edit/delete, or list but no detail view
- **Half-built features**: UI exists with no backend, API endpoint exists with no frontend
- **Missing common patterns**: No search, no pagination, no sorting, no filtering where expected
- **Incomplete user workflows**: Flow starts but dead-ends (create account but can't change password)
- **Missing data features**: No export, no import, no backup, no history/audit trail
- **Absent admin/settings**: No configuration, no admin panel, no user preferences

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep

## Output Format

For each feature gap found, the agent provides:
- **Location**: Relevant file(s) showing the gap
- **Category**: CRUD_GAP, HALF_BUILT, MISSING_PATTERN, DEAD_END, DATA_GAP, or CONFIG_GAP
- **Value**: HIGH_VALUE, MEDIUM_VALUE, or NICE_TO_HAVE
- **Effort**: SMALL (hours), MEDIUM (days), or LARGE (weeks)
- **Current State**: What exists today
- **Missing Feature**: What should be added
- **User Impact**: How users are affected without the feature

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Analyze feature gaps in project management dashboard",
  prompt: "Review the codebase for missing CRUD operations, incomplete workflows, and missing common patterns. Identify all feature gaps that would impact users.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-brainstorm-analyzer-features"
)
```
