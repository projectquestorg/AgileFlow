# Error Analyzer Agent

The Error Analyzer is an expert at **diagnosing errors and exceptions**. It analyzes error messages, stack traces, and logs to identify root causes and suggest fixes - often eliminating the need for external research.

## When to Use

- When a test fails with an unclear error
- When runtime exceptions occur during development
- When build/compilation errors need diagnosis
- When you're stuck on a recurring error
- When you want to understand what went wrong

## How It Works

1. **Parses the error** - Extracts error type, message, location, and call stack
2. **Categorizes** - Determines type of error (null/undefined, type mismatch, import, async, etc.)
3. **Investigates** - Reads error location and call chain in code
4. **Identifies root cause** - Traces back to find where problem originates
5. **Suggests fix** - Provides concrete code changes and prevention strategies

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Parse the Error
Extracts:
- **Error type**: TypeError, ReferenceError, custom exception
- **Error message**: The actual error text
- **Location**: File and line number from stack trace
- **Call stack**: Sequence of function calls

### Step 2: Categorize the Error

| Category | Characteristics | Approach |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Null/Undefined** | "Cannot read property X of undefined" | Find where the undefined value originates |
| **Type Mismatch** | "X is not a function", type errors | Check what type the value actually is |
| **Import/Module** | "Cannot find module", "is not exported" | Check paths, exports, package.json |
| **Async/Promise** | "UnhandledPromiseRejection", timing issues | Look for missing await, unhandled catches |
| **Configuration** | Environment variables, config files | Check .env, config files, defaults |
| **Dependency** | Version conflicts, missing deps | Check package.json, lock file |
| **Build/Compile** | Webpack, TypeScript, Babel errors | Check build config, tsconfig |

### Step 3: Investigate the Code
1. Read the error location
2. Read the call chain from stack trace
3. Search for similar patterns in codebase
4. Look at tests for expected behavior

### Step 4: Identify Root Cause
Looks for common patterns that cause errors.

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash

## Common Error Patterns Cheatsheet

### JavaScript/TypeScript

| Error | Likely Cause | Quick Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| "X is undefined" | Missing null check | Add optional chaining `?.` |
| "X is not a function" | Wrong import/type | Check exports, types |
| "Cannot find module" | Wrong path | Check relative path, index.js |
| "Maximum call stack" | Infinite recursion | Add base case |
| "Assignment to constant" | Reassigning const | Use let or restructure |

### Node.js/npm

| Error | Likely Cause | Quick Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| "ENOENT" | File not found | Check file path exists |
| "EACCES" | Permission denied | Check file permissions |
| "MODULE_NOT_FOUND" | Missing dependency | npm install |
| "peer dependency" | Version conflict | Check versions, --legacy-peer-deps |

### React/Frontend

| Error | Likely Cause | Quick Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| "Invalid hook call" | Hook outside component | Move to component body |
| "Objects not valid as React child" | Rendering object | Convert to string/element |
| "Too many re-renders" | State in render | Move state setter to effect |
| "Hydration mismatch" | Server/client differ | Ensure consistent rendering |

## Output Format

```markdown
## Error Analysis

### Error Summary
- **Type**: TypeError | ReferenceError | etc.
- **Message**: exact error message
- **Location**: file:line

### Stack Trace Analysis
relevant portion of stack trace

The error originates in function at file:line, called from...

### Root Cause

{Clear explanation of WHY this error occurred}

**Evidence**:
- Found in `{file}`: {what was found}
- Related code in `{file}`: {context}

### Suggested Fix

**Option 1** (Recommended):
\`\`\`javascript
// Before:
{problematic code}

// After:
{fixed code}
\`\`\`

**Why this works**: {explanation}

**Option 2** (Alternative):
{alternative approach if applicable}

### Prevention

To prevent similar issues:
1. {preventive measure}
2. {another measure}
```

## Example Analysis

Given an error like:
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
  at getUserProfile (auth.ts:45)
  at handleAuthCallback (auth.ts:67)
```

The Error Analyzer would:
1. Identify: User object is undefined at line 45
2. Trace: Back to where user comes from
3. Find: API response doesn't include user
4. Suggest: Add null check with optional chaining or default

## Important Rules

1. **Read before guessing** - Always read the actual code at error location
2. **Follow the stack** - Trace back to find where bad data originated
3. **Check the obvious** - Often it's a typo, missing import, or simple oversight
4. **Consider timing** - Async code is common source of "undefined" errors
5. **Version matters** - Check if error started after dependency update

## When to Recommend External Research

Only suggest research when:
- Error involves unfamiliar library internals
- Documentation is needed for correct API usage
- Issue seems to be a known bug in a dependency
- Multiple fix attempts have failed

Even then, provide a detailed research prompt.

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Diagnose test failure",
  prompt: "Analyze this test error and identify the root cause. Suggest fixes to resolve the issue.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-error-analyzer"
)
```
