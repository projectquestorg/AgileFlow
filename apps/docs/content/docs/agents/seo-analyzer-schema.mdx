# Schema / Structured Data

The Schema/Structured Data agent is a specialized SEO analyzer focused on **schema markup and structured data optimization**. It detects existing structured data on web pages, validates it against current Google standards, flags deprecated or restricted types, and identifies opportunities for new schema markup to unlock rich results.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to audit schema markup on your pages
- You want to validate JSON-LD against Google standards
- You're working toward rich results (rich snippets, knowledge panels)
- You need to detect deprecated schema types
- You want to generate ready-to-use schema markup for your pages

## How It Works

1. **Detects existing schema** - Finds JSON-LD, Microdata, and RDFa on the page
2. **Validates format** - Checks valid JSON, correct @context (https://schema.org), recognized @types
3. **Checks required properties** - Validates type-specific required fields are present
4. **Flags deprecated types** - Warns about types Google no longer supports (HowTo, SpecialAnnouncement, etc.)
5. **Identifies restricted types** - Notes types with limited eligibility (FAQPage, ClaimReview)
6. **Finds missing opportunities** - Recommends schema based on page content and type
7. **Generates ready-to-use snippets** - Creates copy-paste JSON-LD for missing schema

## Focus Areas

- **Detection**: Find existing JSON-LD, Microdata, and RDFa
- **Validation**: Check required properties, format correctness, Google compliance
- **Deprecated Types**: Flag types no longer supported (HowTo, SpecialAnnouncement, CourseInfo)
- **Restricted Types**: Warn about types with limited eligibility (FAQPage, ClaimReview)
- **Missing Opportunities**: Identify schema that should be present based on page content
- **Rich Result Eligibility**: Assess which rich results the page could unlock

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch

```text
Task(
  description: "Detect and validate schema markup",
  prompt: "Analyze schema markup on https://example.com/product. Detect existing JSON-LD, validate against Google standards, flag deprecated types, and recommend missing opportunities.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-seo-analyzer-schema"
)
```

## Output Format

```markdown
FINDING-1: Missing Product returnPolicyCountry

Category: Validation Error
URL: https://example.com/product
Severity: HIGH
Confidence: HIGH

Existing Schema:
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "Laptop",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "999",
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  }
}

Issue: Product schema missing mandatory returnPolicyCountry (required as of March 2025).

Remediation:
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "Laptop",
  "offers": {

    "price": "999",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "returnPolicyCountry": "US"
  }
}
```

## Scoring Guide

| Aspect | Weight | Deductions |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Has relevant schema | 30% | -30 if no schema at all |
| Validation passes | 25% | -5 per validation error |
| No deprecated types | 15% | -15 per deprecated type |
| Required properties present | 20% | -5 per missing property |
| Format correctness | 10% | -10 for Microdata, -5 for minor issues |

## Important Rules

1. **Parse actual JSON-LD** - Extract real schema from the page, don't guess
2. **Validate against current standards** - Use 2025-2026 Google documentation
3. **Generate working snippets** - Remediation code should be copy-paste ready
4. **Note business type** - Schema recommendations depend on site purpose
5. **Prioritize rich results** - Focus on schema that unlocks search features
