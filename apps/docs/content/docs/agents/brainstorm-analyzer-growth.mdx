# Growth & Engagement

The Brainstorm Analyzer: Growth & Engagement agent is a specialized growth analyzer focused on **identifying features that drive user engagement, retention, and growth**. It analyzes the app and suggests features that would help acquire users, keep them active, and encourage them to invite others.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You want to improve user onboarding and activation
- You need to identify notification and communication gaps
- You're looking for sharing and virality features
- You want to find personalization opportunities
- You need to identify retention hooks (streaks, reminders, digests)
- You're analyzing user management and account features

## How It Works

1. **Maps user lifecycle** - Analyzes acquisition, activation, retention, revenue, and referral stages
2. **Identifies missing growth features** - Finds gaps in onboarding, notifications, sharing, personalization, retention hooks, and user management
3. **Assesses growth metrics** - Determines what metric each feature would improve
4. **Provides implementation hints** - Suggests technical approaches for each growth feature

## Focus Areas

- **Onboarding & activation**: Getting new users to their "aha moment" quickly
- **Notifications & communication**: Keeping users informed and engaged
- **Sharing & virality**: Letting users share content and invite others
- **Personalization**: Making the experience feel tailored to each user
- **Retention hooks**: Features that bring users back (streaks, reminders, digests)
- **User management**: Account features that reduce friction (SSO, multi-account, teams)

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep

## Output Format

For each growth feature suggestion, the agent provides:
- **Location**: Relevant file(s) or area
- **Category**: ONBOARDING, NOTIFICATIONS, SHARING, PERSONALIZATION, RETENTION, or USER_MGMT
- **Value**: HIGH_VALUE, MEDIUM_VALUE, or NICE_TO_HAVE
- **Effort**: SMALL (hours), MEDIUM (days), or LARGE (weeks)
- **Growth Metric**: What metric this improves (activation rate, DAU, retention, referrals)
- **Current State**: What exists today
- **Missing Feature**: What should be added
- **Growth Impact**: How the feature improves user engagement

## Example Usage

  description: "Identify growth and engagement opportunities",
