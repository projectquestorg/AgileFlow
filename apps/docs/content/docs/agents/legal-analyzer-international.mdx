# International

The Legal Analyzer - International agent (AG-LEGAL-INTL) is a compliance specialist who identifies multi-jurisdiction compliance gaps for globally accessible applications. This agent analyzes legal risks from serving users in multiple countries without meeting their local data protection and consumer laws.

## Capabilities

- **LGPD Compliance**: Brazilian General Data Protection Law requirements
- **PIPL Analysis**: China's Personal Information Protection Law obligations
- **Data Localization**: Identify data residency requirements by jurisdiction
- **Cross-Border Transfers**: Evaluate data transfer mechanisms (SCCs, adequacy decisions)
- **Multi-Jurisdiction Mapping**: Map which laws apply based on user locations
- **Language Requirements**: Identify mandatory translation obligations for legal documents
- **Local Representative**: Determine when local representative appointment is required
- **Regulatory Differences**: Highlight where requirements differ between jurisdictions

## When to Use

Use the Legal Analyzer - International when:

- Application is accessible globally (most web apps)
- Specifically targeting users in EU, Brazil, China, or other regulated jurisdictions
- Storing data in cloud providers across multiple regions
- Need to evaluate data localization requirements
- Expanding to new geographic markets
- Processing data from users in multiple countries
- Need cross-border data transfer compliance (Standard Contractual Clauses, etc.)
- Preparing for international regulatory audit

## How It Works

1. **Jurisdiction Detection**: Agent identifies which countries users likely come from
2. **Law Mapping**: Agent maps applicable data protection laws per jurisdiction
3. **Gap Analysis**: Agent compares current compliance against each jurisdiction's requirements
4. **Transfer Assessment**: Agent evaluates cross-border data flows
5. **Localization Check**: Agent verifies data residency compliance
6. **Language Review**: Agent checks for required translations of legal documents
7. **Risk Rating**: Agent rates exposure by jurisdiction
8. **Remediation Plan**: Agent prioritizes compliance actions by user concentration

## Example

```bash
# Via legal audit - international compliance check
/agileflow:legal:audit . DEPTH=deep FOCUS=international

# Agent output:
# International Compliance Audit
#
# Application: SaaS with global users
# Data Hosting: US (AWS us-east-1)
# Jurisdictions Detected: EU, Brazil, India, Japan
# Risk Level: HIGH
#
# CRITICAL FINDINGS:
# 1. EU data stored in US without SCCs
#    Issue: EU user data transfers to US servers
#    Since Schrems II: Standard Contractual Clauses required
#    Risk: GDPR fines up to 4% annual revenue
#    Fix: Implement SCCs or use EU data center (varies)
#
# 2. No LGPD compliance for Brazilian users
#    Issue: Application collects data from Brazil without LGPD compliance
#    Requirements: Consent, DPO appointment, data subject rights
#    Risk: LGPD fines up to 2% revenue (capped at R$50M)
#    Fix: Add LGPD-specific consent and rights mechanisms (16 hours)
#
# HIGH FINDINGS:
# 3. Privacy policy only in English (EU requires local language)
# 4. No data localization for Russian users (242-FZ)
# 5. Missing APPI compliance for Japanese users
#
# Jurisdiction Priority (by user concentration):
# 1. EU (40% of users) - GDPR: 3 gaps
# 2. Brazil (15%) - LGPD: 4 gaps
# 3. Japan (8%) - APPI: 2 gaps
# 4. India (5%) - DPDP: 1 gap
```
