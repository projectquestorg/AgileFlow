- **Character limit verification** across platforms
- **Mobile-first design assessment**
- **Creative fatigue detection** based on frequency and age
- **Testing methodology evaluation** for A/B testing best practices

## Platform Safe Zones

**TikTok**: Top 130px (username), Bottom 170px (CTA), Right 100px (engagement buttons)

**YouTube**: Skip button overlay (bottom-right), Info cards (top-right)

## Quality Gates

- **Restricted content** triggers CRITICAL - Prohibited content = immediate failure
- **No creative = no campaign** - Must have at least 1 compliant creative per ad set
- **Ad fatigue** requires refresh - Frequency > 3.0 with declining CTR = mandatory new creatives
