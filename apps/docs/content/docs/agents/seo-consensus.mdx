# SEO Consensus Coordinator

The SEO Consensus Coordinator is the **lead agent for SEO audits**. It collects findings from all specialized SEO analyzers, weighs them by category, aggregates into a health score (0-100), classifies findings by business type, and produces the final prioritized SEO Audit Report.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You've completed a full SEO audit with multiple analyzers
- You need to synthesize findings from 6+ analyzers into a single score
- You want a weighted, business-aware SEO health score
- You need a prioritized action plan from audit findings
- You want to generate the final SEO Audit Report

## How It Works

1. **Classifies business type** - Determines SaaS, Local Business, E-commerce, Publisher, or Agency
2. **Collects findings** - Parses all analyzer outputs into normalized structure
3. **Calculates category scores** - Applies deductions from each analyzer's findings
4. **Weights by category** - Applies category weights to compute overall health score
5. **Cross-references** - Finds issues flagged by multiple analyzers (higher confidence)
6. **Prioritizes** - Ranks findings by impact × effort
7. **Generates report** - Produces actionable SEO Audit Report with health score

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep

## Priority Criteria

| Priority | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Blocks indexing, causes penalties | noindex on key pages, not crawlable |
| **High** | Direct ranking impact, easy fix | Missing titles, broken canonicals, no schema |
| **Medium** | Ranking opportunity, moderate effort | Thin content, image optimization, CWV |
| **Low** | Nice-to-have, significant effort | Minor URL cleanup, additional schema |

## Cross-Reference Examples

Issues flagged by multiple analyzers get higher priority:
- **Image without alt + CLS from unsized** → Confirmed critical
- **Missing schema + low E-E-A-T** → Related, higher confidence
- **Render-blocking + slow load** → Confirmed high priority

## Business Type Emphasis

### SaaS
- Content marketing strategy (blog, guides, docs)
- Technical SEO foundation (crawlability, indexability)
- Organization and Product schema
- Performance optimization (fast TTFB, Core Web Vitals)

### Local Business
- Local schema (LocalBusiness, address, phone)
- NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency across pages
- Google Business Profile optimization
- Review signals and testimonials

### E-commerce
- Product schema with structured data
- Site structure (category, product pages)
- Image optimization (product photos)
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS for product pages)
- Programmatic content quality gates

### Publisher
- E-E-A-T signals (author credentials, expertise)
- Article/BlogPosting schema with dates
- Content depth and originality
- Freshness signals (recent publication dates)
- Topic authority and clusters

### Agency
- Authority signals (portfolio, case studies)
- Service schema for service pages
- Team expertise signals
- Testimonials and client logos

## Important Rules

1. **Show your math** - Make scoring transparent with category breakdowns
2. **Be actionable** - Every finding must have a specific fix
3. **Prioritize by business type** - E-commerce needs Product schema; publishers need E-E-A-T
4. **Cross-reference findings** - Issues by multiple analyzers = higher confidence
5. **Quick wins first** - Lead action plan with easy, high-impact fixes
6. **Save the report** - Write to `docs/08-project/seo-audits/seo-audit-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
7. **No false urgency** - Score honestly, not everything is critical

## Edge Cases

- **No findings from an analyzer** → Category score = 100
- **Only one analyzer** → Report that category, no overall score
- **Completely broken site** → Report Critical findings, score 0-20
- **Already well-optimized** → Score 85+, focus on incremental improvements
