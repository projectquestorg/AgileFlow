# Brainstorm Consensus Coordinator

The Brainstorm Consensus Coordinator is the **lead orchestrator for the Brainstorm Audit system**. It collects feature suggestions from all brainstorm analyzers, detects the app category, deduplicates overlapping suggestions, votes on value, and produces a final prioritized Feature Brainstorm Report.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You want to run a complete brainstorm audit across multiple analyzers
- You need to synthesize findings from all 5 brainstorm analyzers into one prioritized report
- You want to detect your app's category and filter irrelevant suggestions
- You need to identify quick wins (high value, low effort features)
- You're planning feature prioritization and roadmapping
- You want a consensus-driven approach to product planning

## How It Works

1. **Detects app category** - Determines what kind of app this is (SaaS, E-commerce, Blog, Tool, etc.) from code analysis
2. **Collects all findings** - Gathers feature suggestions from Features, UX, Market, Growth, and Integration analyzers
3. **Deduplicates suggestions** - Merges overlapping ideas from different analyzers
4. **Votes on value** - Multiple analyzers suggesting the same feature increases confidence
5. **Filters by relevance** - Excludes features that don't fit the app category
6. **Prioritizes by value/effort** - Ranks features using a priority matrix
7. **Generates report** - Produces actionable Feature Brainstorm Report with quick wins first

## Focus Areas

- **App category detection**: Infers from code what kind of app this is
- **Finding normalization**: Converts all analyzer outputs to a standard format
- **Deduplication**: Merges overlapping suggestions from multiple analyzers
- **Confidence scoring**: HIGH (2+ analyzers agree), MEDIUM (strong justification), LOW (speculative)
- **Category filtering**: Excludes irrelevant features for the app type
- **Priority matrix**: Ranks by value vs effort (quick wins, strategic, easy adds, consider later)

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep

## Report Output Format

The Brainstorm Consensus Coordinator produces:
- **Executive Summary** - Total findings, after deduplication, confidence breakdown
- **Quick Wins** - High value, low effort (do these first)
- **Strategic Features** - High value, higher effort (worth investing in)
- **Easy Additions** - Medium value, low effort (nice improvements)
- **Consider Later** - Lower priority items
- **Excluded** - Features filtered as irrelevant to app category
- **Summary by Category** - Breakdown by feature type
- **Recommended Next Steps** - Specific action items

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Run complete brainstorm audit and generate prioritized report",
  prompt: "Analyze the codebase with all brainstorm analyzers (features, ux, market, growth, integration). Detect the app category, deduplicate findings, and generate a prioritized Feature Brainstorm Report with quick wins first.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-brainstorm-consensus"
)
```

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Detect app category** - Classify as SaaS, E-commerce, Blog, Developer Tool, Portfolio, AI/ML, Social, Dashboard, or Marketplace
2. **Collect findings** - Parse all 5 analyzer outputs into normalized structure
3. **Deduplicate aggressively** - Merge similar findings from multiple analyzers
4. **Confidence voting** - Mark findings confirmed (2+ analyzers), likely (strong justification), or speculative
5. **Filter irrelevant features** - Exclude features that don't fit the detected category
6. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Use value/effort matrix to rank by impact
7. **Generate actionable report** - Produce report with clear next steps
