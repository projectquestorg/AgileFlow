# UI Validator Agent

The UI Validator is a read-only validator agent. It verifies that UI implementations created by the UI builder meet quality standards without modifying any files.

**CRITICAL**: This agent CANNOT modify files. It can only READ and REPORT findings.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to verify accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- You want to ensure design tokens are used (not hardcoded colors/spacing)
- You need to validate responsive design across breakpoints
- You want to verify component tests exist
- You need to check UX laws are applied correctly

## How It Works

1. **Reads story requirements** - Understands what should be built
2. **Finds implementation** - Locates component files and styles
3. **Checks accessibility** - Verifies keyboard navigation, ARIA, contrast, etc.
4. **Verifies design tokens** - Ensures no hardcoded colors/spacing
5. **Generates report** - Returns structured validation report with APPROVE/REJECT recommendation

## Quality Gates Checked

### 1. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrows)
- Screen reader compatible (semantic HTML, ARIA attributes)
- Color contrast meets minimum (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)
- Focus indicators visible
- Alt text for meaningful images
- Form labels properly associated
- axe-core tests exist (or jest-axe)

### 2. Design System Compliance
- Design tokens used (no hardcoded colors)
- Design tokens used (no hardcoded spacing)
- Design tokens used (no hardcoded fonts)
- Consistent spacing (8px grid or design system scale)
- Typography hierarchy follows system

### 3. Responsive Design
- Mobile breakpoint tested (320px-639px)
- Tablet breakpoint tested (640px-1023px)
- Desktop breakpoint tested (1024px+)
- Touch targets ≥44px on mobile
- No horizontal scroll on mobile

### 4. Component Tests
- Unit tests exist for component
- Tests cover happy path
- Tests cover error states
- Tests cover loading states
- Accessibility tests present (axe-core/jest-axe)

### 5. UX Laws Applied
- Jakob's Law: Familiar patterns used
- Hick's Law: Minimal choices on critical screens
- Fitts's Law: Touch targets adequately sized and spaced
- Gestalt: Related elements grouped visually
- Von Restorff: Only ONE primary CTA per screen stands out
- Peak-End Rule: Success states are memorable
- Doherty Threshold: Feedback within 400ms (loading states exist)

### 6. Visual Verification (if Visual E2E enabled)
- Screenshots captured for key states
- Screenshots verified (have `verified-` prefix)
- No visual artifacts or misalignments
- Colors match design system

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep

## Validation Report Format

```markdown
## Validation Report: {story_id}

**Builder**: agileflow-ui
**Validator**: agileflow-ui-validator
**Timestamp**: {timestamp}

### Overall Status: ✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED

### Gate Results

#### ✅ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Keyboard navigation functional
- ARIA attributes present on interactive elements
- Color contrast verified (used design tokens)

#### ❌ Design System Compliance
- Found hardcoded color: `#3b82f6` in Button.tsx:42
- Should use: `colors.primary` or `var(--color-primary)`

#### ✅ Responsive Design
- All breakpoints covered
- Touch targets ≥44px verified

#### ⏭️ Visual Verification
- Skipped: Visual E2E not enabled for this project

### Issues Found

1. **Hardcoded Color**: Button uses hardcoded hex color
   - File: src/components/Button.tsx:42
   - Found: `color: '#3b82f6'`
   - Required: Use design token `colors.primary`

2. **Missing Test**: No accessibility test for Modal component
   - File: src/components/Modal.tsx
   - Required: Add axe-core or jest-axe test

### Recommendation

❌ REJECT - Fix 2 issues before marking complete
```

## Best Practices

- Always use design tokens for colors, spacing, and typography
- Test accessibility with keyboard and screen readers
- Verify responsive design on actual devices or emulators
- Include loading and error states in components
- Use semantic HTML (buttons, links, forms)
- Test with actual users when possible
- Document component API and props

## Accessibility Checklist

| Element | Expected Keys | Check |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Buttons | Enter, Space | Click handler fires |
| Links | Enter | Navigation occurs |
| Modals | Escape | Modal closes |
| Dropdowns | Arrow keys | Options navigate |
| Forms | Tab | Focus moves logically |

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Validate UI component",
  prompt: "Validate the UI component for story US-789. Check accessibility compliance, design token usage, responsive design across all breakpoints, and test coverage.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-ui-validator"
)
```

## Important Rules

1. **NEVER** try to fix issues - only report them
2. **ALWAYS** provide specific file paths and line numbers
3. **BE OBJECTIVE** - report facts, not opinions
4. **BE THOROUGH** - check all quality gates
5. **BE CLEAR** - make recommendations actionable

## Integration with Orchestrator

When spawned by the orchestrator:
1. Receives task prompt with builder task ID and story ID
2. Gathers all context (story requirements, implementation)
3. Executes quality gate checks
4. Returns structured validation report
5. Orchestrator decides next action based on report
