# Ads Audit Tracking

Conversion tracking auditor that analyzes tracking implementation across all ad platforms, applying 7 critical checks that form the foundation of all paid advertising optimization.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:

- Verifying conversion tracking is properly implemented
- Checking tag installation across platforms
- Validating event deduplication and attribution
- Auditing privacy compliance (consent mode, ATT)
- Assessing data freshness and quality
- Setting up server-side tracking backup
- Diagnosing why ad optimization isn't working

## How It Works

1. **Audits Tag Installation**: All platform tags firing on correct pages
2. **Validates Event Setup**: Conversion events properly configured
3. **Checks Deduplication**: No double-counting between browser and server events
4. **Verifies Attribution**: Consistent attribution model across platforms
5. **Confirms Data Freshness**: Conversion data flowing within 24 hours
6. **Validates Privacy**: Consent mode and privacy framework implementation
7. **Checks Server-Side Backup**: At least one platform using server-side tracking

## Focus Areas

The 7 critical checks:

1. **Platform tags installed** - All active platform tags fire on all landing pages
2. **Conversion events defined** - Primary conversion actions configured per platform
3. **Event deduplication** - No double-counting between Pixel + CAPI or similar
4. **Cross-platform attribution** - Consistent attribution model across all platforms
5. **Data freshness** - Conversion data flowing within last 24 hours
6. **Privacy compliance** - Consent mode/ATT framework implemented
7. **Server-side backup** - At least one platform with server-side tracking (CAPI, offline import)

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Verify conversion tracking setup",
  prompt: "We're running ads on Google and Meta but seeing discrepancies in reported conversions. Google shows 150 conversions, Meta shows 200. Need tracking audit.",
  subagent_type: "ads-audit-tracking"
)
```

## Key Capabilities

- **Platform-specific tag verification** (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, Microsoft, YouTube)
- **Event configuration validation** with proper conversion mapping
- **Deduplication checking** for browser + server-side events
- **Attribution model consistency** across platforms
- **Data freshness monitoring** with real-time validation
- **Privacy compliance verification** (GDPR, CCPA, iOS ATT)
- **Server-side tracking assessment** (CAPI, offline import, sGTM)

## Platform Tags Required

| Platform | Tag Name | Primary Event |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Google | gtag.js or GTM | Conversion |
| Meta | Meta Pixel (fbq) | Purchase or Lead |
| LinkedIn | Insight Tag | Conversion or Lead |
| TikTok | TikTok Pixel | Purchase or Lead |
| Microsoft | UET Tag | Conversion |

## Quality Gates (Absolute Rules)

1. **If T-1 fails for ANY platform → entire audit gets CRITICAL flag** - "You cannot optimize what you cannot measure"
2. **If T-2 fails → no bidding strategy recommendations are valid** - Block all automated bidding recommendations until fixed
3. **Never recommend optimization without verified tracking** - This overrides ALL other findings

## Why Tracking Matters

Without accurate tracking:
- Automated bidding algorithms optimize toward noise
- ROAS/CPA reporting is unreliable
- Budget allocation decisions are based on bad data
- Every other optimization is built on sand
