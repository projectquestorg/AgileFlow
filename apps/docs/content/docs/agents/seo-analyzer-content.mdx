# Content Quality & E-E-A-T

The Content Quality & E-E-A-T agent is a specialized SEO analyzer focused on **content quality and E-E-A-T signals** (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness). It assesses a website's content for user trust, author credentials, domain authority, and original insights.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to assess content quality from Google's E-E-A-T perspective
- You're evaluating trustworthiness signals (contact info, transparency, HTTPS)
- You want to measure expertise signals (author credentials, citations, technical depth)
- You're checking for thin content or generic AI-generated phrasing
- You need to assess content readiness for AI search platform citation

## How It Works

4. **Assesses Authoritativeness (25%)** - Examines brand signals, testimonials, certifications, consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone)
5. **Assesses Experience (20%)** - Looks for first-hand accounts, original media, specific data, case studies
6. **Evaluates Content Depth** - Measures word count against page type minimums (500w homepage, 800w service, 1,500w blog)
7. **Checks AI Citation Readiness** - Assesses whether content is structured for AI platforms to quote (134-167 word answer blocks)

## Focus Areas
