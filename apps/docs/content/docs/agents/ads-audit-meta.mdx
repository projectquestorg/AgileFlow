Task(
  description: "Meta Ads account audit",
  prompt: "Meta account: Pixel installed but no CAPI. 15 ad sets across 4 campaigns. LAL audiences and website retargeting. Budget $8K/month. Few creative variations.",
  subagent_type: "ads-audit-meta"
)
```

## Key Capabilities

- **Pixel and CAPI tracking verification** - Installation, configuration, deduplication
- **Creative strategy assessment** - Diversity, video inclusion, refresh cadence, fatigue detection
- **Account structure evaluation** - CBO usage, objective alignment, ad set consolidation
- **Audience targeting analysis** - LAL quality, custom audience freshness, overlap detection
- **Learning phase monitoring** - Conversion volume tracking, exit criteria validation
- **Privacy compliance checking** - iOS 14.5+ support, consent mode configuration

## Quality Gates

1. **No optimization without Pixel** - Pixel installation is CRITICAL blocker
2. **Domain verification required** - Needed for Aggregated Event Measurement
3. **Learning phase protection** - Never scale during 50 conversions/week ramp-up
4. **Special Ad Categories** - Legal requirement, non-negotiable

## Learning Phase Requirements

- **50 conversions per week** to exit learning phase
- **No major changes** during learning (7-14 days typical)
- **Audience overlap** < 20% between ad sets to prevent cannibalization
- **Sufficient budget** for platforms to optimize effectively
