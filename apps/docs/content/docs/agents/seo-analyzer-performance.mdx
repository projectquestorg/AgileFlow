# Performance & Core Web Vitals

The Performance & Core Web Vitals agent is a specialized SEO analyzer focused on **web performance and ranking signals**. It assesses a website's performance characteristics by analyzing page structure, resource loading patterns, and identifying factors that impact LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), INP (Interaction to Next Paint), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift).

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to identify Core Web Vitals performance issues
- You're optimizing for LCP (page paint speed)
- You want to reduce Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- You're analyzing Interaction to Next Paint (INP) responsiveness
- You need to find render-blocking resources slowing your page

## How It Works

1. **Fetches the target page** - Analyzes HTML structure for performance indicators
2. **Analyzes LCP** - Identifies the largest contentful paint element (hero image, text, video)
3. **Checks INP Performance** - Looks for main-thread blocking JavaScript and long tasks
4. **Assesses CLS Risk** - Identifies layout shift sources (unsized images, web fonts, dynamic content)
5. **Reviews Resource Loading** - Detects render-blocking CSS/JS, compression, preload/preconnect hints
6. **Evaluates Third-Party Impact** - Assesses external scripts impact on performance
7. **Checks Caching Headers** - Reviews cache strategy and CDN indicators

## Focus Areas

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: ≤ 2.5s (Good), optimize hero images, resource priorities, server response
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)**: ≤ 200ms (Good), minimize JS execution, event handler efficiency
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: ≤ 0.1 (Good), image/ad sizing, font loading, dynamic content
- **Resource Loading**: Render-blocking CSS/JS, preload/preconnect hints, compression
- **Third-Party Impact**: External scripts, fonts, analytics, ads blocking performance
- **Caching**: Cache headers, static asset versioning, CDN usage

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch

## Core Web Vitals Targets

| Vital | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|-------|------|------------------|------|
| **LCP** | ≤ 2.5s | 2.5-4.0s | > 4.0s |
| **INP** | ≤ 200ms | 200-500ms | > 500ms |
| **CLS** | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1-0.25 | > 0.25 |

## LCP Optimization Checklist

| Factor | Good | Issue |
|--------|------|-------|
| LCP image has `fetchpriority="high"` | Yes | Missing priority hint |
| LCP image is preloaded | `<link rel="preload">` | No preload |
| LCP image format | WebP/AVIF | Legacy JPEG/PNG |
| No lazy loading on LCP | `loading="eager"` or none | `loading="lazy"` on LCP ❌ |
| Server response | Fast TTFB indicators | Slow server (>800ms) |

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Analyze Core Web Vitals performance",
  prompt: "Assess performance characteristics of https://example.com. Analyze LCP, INP, CLS, render-blocking resources, third-party impact, and identify optimization opportunities.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-seo-analyzer-performance"
)
```

## Output Format

```markdown
FINDING-1: Render-blocking CSS in <head>

Category: Resource Loading
URL: https://example.com
Severity: HIGH
Confidence: HIGH
CWV Impact: LCP

Issue: Large CSS file blocks rendering until downloaded and parsed.

Evidence:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/main.css"> (45KB)

Impact: Delays LCP by estimated 300-500ms

Remediation:
1. Inline critical CSS: Move above-fold styles to <style> tag
2. Defer non-critical: Add media="print" or async CSS loading
3. Consider CSS-in-JS: Dynamic loading for component styles
```

## Scoring Guide

| Aspect | Weight | Deductions |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| LCP optimization | 30% | -10 per critical LCP issue |
| INP optimization | 25% | -10 per main-thread blocking |
| CLS prevention | 25% | -5 per layout shift risk |
| Resource loading | 10% | -3 per render-blocking resource |
| Third-party management | 10% | -2 per unmanaged third-party |

## Important Rules

1. **Analyze HTML structure** - Performance issues visible in page source
2. **Estimate, don't measure** - Without running Lighthouse, estimate based on patterns
3. **Prioritize CWV** - LCP, INP, CLS are Google's ranking signals
4. **Note field vs lab** - Recommend CrUX data for real-world metrics
5. **Be specific** - Point to exact elements and resources causing issues

## Common Issues Found

- Render-blocking JavaScript in `<head>`
- Large hero images without optimization
- Missing `fetchpriority="high"` on LCP image
- Unsized images causing layout shift
- Synchronous third-party scripts
- Web fonts blocking text rendering
- Uncompressed text resources
