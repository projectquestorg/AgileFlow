# Technical SEO

The Technical SEO agent is a specialized analyzer focused on **technical SEO foundations**. It assesses a website's technical foundation by analyzing crawlability, indexability, security, URL structure, mobile readiness, JavaScript rendering, and performance indicators.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to audit your site's technical SEO foundation
- You're troubleshooting indexing or crawling issues
- You want to verify security headers are properly configured
- You need to check mobile-friendliness signals
- You want to ensure proper canonical tags and redirect handling

## How It Works

1. **Fetches target pages** - Analyzes HTTP headers and HTML structure
2. **Checks crawlability** - Reviews robots.txt, meta robots directives, canonicals, redirects
3. **Assesses indexability** - Looks for noindex directives, orphan pages, sitemap coverage
4. **Verifies security** - Checks HTTPS, HSTS, CSP, security headers
5. **Analyzes URL structure** - Evaluates cleanliness, hierarchy, parameters, consistency
6. **Reviews mobile readiness** - Checks viewport, responsive design, tap targets
7. **Detects JS rendering** - Identifies client-side content and rendering patterns
8. **Checks international signals** - Looks for hreflang, language declarations

## Focus Areas

- **Crawlability**: robots.txt rules, meta robots, canonicals, redirect chains
- **Indexability**: noindex directives, orphan pages, crawl depth, XML sitemap
- **Security**: HTTPS enforcement, HSTS headers, CSP, mixed content
- **URL Structure**: Clean URLs, hierarchy, parameters, trailing slash consistency
- **Mobile-Friendliness**: Viewport meta, responsive design, tap targets, readability
- **Core Web Vitals Indicators**: Resource loading, render-blocking resources, CLS risk
- **International**: hreflang tags, language declarations, geo-targeting
- **JavaScript Rendering**: Client-side rendering detection, hydration

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch

## 8 Assessment Categories

| Category | Weight | Key Checks |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Crawlability | 25% | robots.txt, canonicals, redirects, crawl depth |
| Indexability | 20% | noindex directives, orphans, sitemap coverage |
| Security | 15% | HTTPS, HSTS, CSP, security headers |
| URL Structure | 15% | Cleanliness, hierarchy, consistency |
| Mobile | 15% | Viewport, responsive, tap targets |
| JS Rendering | 5% | Client-side content visibility |
| International | 3% | hreflang, language declarations |
| Performance | 2% | TTFB, resource hints, compression |

## Security Headers Checklist

| Header | Expected | Severity if Missing |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Strict-Transport-Security | max-age=31536000 | HIGH |
| X-Content-Type-Options | nosniff | MEDIUM |
| X-Frame-Options | DENY or SAMEORIGIN | MEDIUM |
| Content-Security-Policy | Present | MEDIUM |
| Referrer-Policy | strict-origin-when-cross-origin | LOW |
| Permissions-Policy | Present | LOW |

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Deep technical SEO analysis",
  prompt: "Perform comprehensive technical SEO analysis of https://example.com. Check crawlability, indexability, security headers, URL structure, mobile-friendliness, and performance indicators.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-seo-analyzer-technical"
)
```

## Output Format

```markdown
FINDING-1: Missing Strict-Transport-Security header

Category: Security
URL: https://example.com
Severity: HIGH
Confidence: HIGH

Issue: HSTS header not configured. Site is vulnerable to SSL downgrade attacks.

Evidence:
HTTP response headers missing Strict-Transport-Security

Impact: Browsers won't force HTTPS on subsequent visits. Reduces security.

Remediation:
Add to your web server config:
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

## Mobile Readiness Checks

```html
<!-- Essential viewport meta tag -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

<!-- Check for responsive design indicators -->
<!-- Media queries in CSS -->
<!-- Flexible layouts (not fixed widths) -->

<!-- Touch-friendly sizing -->
<!-- Min 48x48px tap targets -->
<!-- Base font size: 16px minimum -->
```

## Canonical Tag Best Practices

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| `<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/page">` | Relative paths |
| Self-referencing on unique pages | Missing entirely |
| Cross-domain canonicals when needed | Canonicals to different domain without reason |
| HTTPS matching page protocol | HTTP on HTTPS page |

## URL Structure Best Practices

- Use lowercase (consistency)
- Hyphens for word separation (not underscores)
- No special characters or encoded spaces
- Reasonable depth (max 3-4 levels)
- Consistent trailing slash usage
- Canonical tags for parameterized URLs

## Scoring Guide

| Category | Weight | Scoring |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Crawlability | 25% | Deduct for blocked resources, broken canonicals |
| Indexability | 20% | Deduct for noindex, orphans, missing sitemap |
| Security | 15% | Deduct for missing HTTPS, missing headers |
| URL Structure | 15% | Deduct for messy URLs, inconsistencies |
| Mobile | 15% | Deduct for missing viewport, non-responsive |
| Performance | 10% | Deduct for render-blocking, missing hints |

## Important Rules

1. **Use WebFetch** - Retrieve actual page content, check HTTP headers
2. **Check headers** - Many technical SEO issues are in HTTP response headers
3. **Follow redirects** - Note redirect chains and their types (301 vs 302)
4. **Be specific** - Include exact URLs and header values in findings
5. **Score conservatively** - Only deduct for confirmed issues, not theoretical ones

## Common Issues Found

- Missing HTTPS or mixed content
- robots.txt blocking important resources
- Broken canonical tags (self-referencing needed)
- Redirect chains (should be direct)
- Duplicate content without canonicals
- Missing viewport meta tag
- Non-responsive design on mobile
- Orphan pages not linked from navigation
- Missing XML sitemap
- Crawl depth too deep (>4 levels)
