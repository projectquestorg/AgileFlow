# Legal Analyzer - AI & Algorithms

The Legal Analyzer - AI agent (AG-LEGAL-AI) is a compliance specialist who identifies legal risks in AI and algorithmic systems. This agent analyzes code and data pipelines for EU AI Act, FTC AI disclosure requirements, automated decision-making liability, and bias risks that expose your organization to regulatory action and litigation.

## Capabilities

- **EU AI Act Compliance**: Identify high-risk AI systems requiring compliance documentation
- **FTC AI Disclosure Requirements**: Ensure transparent disclosure of AI-generated content and automated decisions
- **Algorithmic Bias Detection**: Identify discriminatory patterns and fairness issues
- **Automated Decision Accountability**: Verify systems make explainable decisions
- **Training Data Analysis**: Assess data quality and potential bias sources
- **Model Fairness Assessment**: Evaluate performance across demographic groups
- **Transparency Documentation**: Generate required disclosures and explanations
- **Regulatory Exposure**: Map compliance gaps to FTC, EEOC, state regulations

## When to Use

Use the Legal Analyzer - AI when:

- Implementing machine learning or AI features
- Using algorithmic decision-making (hiring, lending, content moderation, pricing)
- Training models on user data
- Deploying large language models or generative AI
- Generating AI content (text, images, code)
- Making automated decisions affecting user rights
- Need FTC compliance documentation for AI features
- Evaluating third-party AI/ML services
- Responding to bias complaints or discrimination claims

## How It Works

1. **System Inventory**: Agent identifies all AI/ML components and decision points
2. **Compliance Assessment**: Agent maps systems to EU AI Act risk categories and FTC requirements
3. **Training Data Audit**: Agent analyzes data for bias sources and documentation gaps
4. **Fairness Analysis**: Agent evaluates model performance across demographic groups
5. **Disclosure Requirements**: Agent identifies required transparency disclosures
6. **Risk Mapping**: Agent rates regulatory exposure (High/Medium/Low)
7. **Remediation Plan**: Agent recommends compliance actions with effort estimates
8. **Documentation**: Agent creates audit trail and disclosure language

## Example

```bash
# Via babysit - AI compliance audit
/agileflow:babysit
> "We're using ML for loan approval decisions. What are our legal compliance requirements?"

# Agent output:
# AI & Algorithmic Compliance Audit
#
# System: Loan Approval ML Model
# Risk Level: HIGH
# Regulatory Requirements: Fair Lending Act, FTC Endorsement Guides, EU AI Act
#
# CRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAPS:
# 1. No training data bias assessment
#    - Data includes 47% minority applicants but model approves only 23%
#    - Disparate impact risk: EEOC investigation likely
#    - Fix: Retrain with balanced data or fairness constraints (16 hours)
#
# 2. Missing explainability for denied loans
#    - System can't explain why individual loans were rejected
#    - Fair Lending Act requires disclosure of denial reasons
#    - Fix: Implement LIME or SHAP explanations (20 hours)
#
# 3. No transparency disclosure
#    - Users not informed that AI makes decision
#    - FTC requires clear disclosure of AI/automated systems
#    - Fix: Update UI with AI disclosure (4 hours)
#
# 4. Insufficient bias monitoring
#    - No ongoing fairness metrics in production
#    - Discriminatory drift could occur without detection
#    - Fix: Add fairness monitoring dashboard (12 hours)
#
# MEDIUM COMPLIANCE ISSUES:
# - Model trained on historical data with documented discrimination
# - Performance gap: 85% approval for majority group vs 67% for minority groups
# - No human review process for borderline cases
#
# Regulatory Exposure:
# - FTC: Deceptive practices (undisclosed AI) - fines up to $43K per violation
# - EEOC: Disparate impact discrimination - potential class action
# - State regulators: Algorithmic accountability laws (CA, NY, IL)
#
# Compliance Roadmap:
# 1. Bias assessment and retraining (16 hours)
# 2. Explainability implementation (20 hours)
# 3. Transparency disclosure (4 hours)
# 4. Bias monitoring system (12 hours)
# 5. Documentation and audit trail (8 hours)
# Total: 60 hours
#
# After remediation: LOW risk
```

## Key Behaviors

- **Compliance First**: Never downplay AI regulatory risks
- **Fairness Focus**: Identify discriminatory patterns that trigger EEOC complaints
- **Transparency Requirement**: Ensure AI/automated decision-making is disclosed to users
- **Documentation Trail**: Create audit logs proving good-faith compliance efforts
- **Data Governance**: Assess training data for bias and governance gaps
- **Monitoring**: Verify bias and fairness metrics tracked in production
- **Accountability**: Map decisions to explainable factors users can understand

## EU AI Act Risk Categories

| Category | Risk Level | Compliance Requirements |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| **High-Risk AI** | CRITICAL | Extensive documentation, human oversight, bias testing |
| **Biometric systems** | CRITICAL | Prohibited in many cases, strict limitations if allowed |
| **Critical infrastructure** | HIGH | Detailed impact assessment, monitoring |
| **Employment decisions** | HIGH | Explainability, human review, non-discrimination |
| **Educational decisions** | MEDIUM | Transparency, monitoring for bias |
| **Law enforcement** | CRITICAL | Strict limitations, transparency, human review |
| **General-purpose AI** | MEDIUM | Transparency to downstream users |

## FTC AI Requirements

| Requirement | What to Document | Penalty |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **AI Disclosure** | Inform users when AI is used | $43,000+ per violation |
| **Explainability** | Users can understand decision | False advertising claims |
| **Bias Testing** | Evidence of fairness evaluation | Deceptive practices claims |
| **Human Review** | High-risk decisions reviewed by human | Unfair practice findings |
| **Data Provenance** | Where training data came from | Discriminatory practice claims |
| **Performance Parity** | Same accuracy across demographics | Disparate impact liability |

## Common AI Compliance Failures

**Undisclosed AI-generated content**:
```javascript
// Bad: No disclosure that content is AI-generated
const review = await generateReview(product);
displayReview(review); // Users think it's human-written

// Good: Clear disclosure of AI involvement
const review = await generateReview(product);
displayReview({
  text: review,
  disclosure: "This review was generated by AI"
});
```

**Biased model decisions**:
```python
# Bad: Training data has demographic bias
model.fit(historical_loan_data)  # Data reflects past discrimination
predictions = model.predict(applications)  # Perpetuates bias

# Good: Assess and mitigate bias
fairness_metrics = evaluate_fairness(predictions, demographics)
if fairness_metrics.disparate_impact > 0.8:
    retrain_with_fairness_constraints()  # Ensure equitable outcomes
```

**No explainability**:
```javascript
// Bad: Decision is a black box
const approved = model.predict(loanApplication);

// Good: Provide explanation
const result = model.predictWithExplanation(loanApplication);
console.log(result.decision); // "APPROVED"
console.log(result.explanation); // "Strong credit history, 20-year employment, 40% debt-to-income"
```

## Bias Detection Checklist

Before deploying AI systems:

- [ ] Training data composition documented (demographics, sources)
- [ ] Bias assessment completed across demographic groups
- [ ] Model performance parity verified (same accuracy for all groups)
- [ ] Disparate impact ratio measured (80% rule: min group ≥80% of majority group approval rate)
- [ ] Explainability mechanism implemented (users understand decisions)
- [ ] Human review process for high-impact decisions
- [ ] Fairness metrics monitored in production
- [ ] Retraining process includes bias re-assessment
- [ ] Audit trail documents decisions and reasoning
- [ ] Disclosure language added to UI for AI/automated decisions
- [ ] User appeals process for automated decisions
- [ ] Regular fairness audits scheduled
