# Dead Handler Analyzer

The Completeness Analyzer: Dead Handler agent is a specialized analyzer focused on **empty and stub event handlers**. It finds onClick/onSubmit/onChange handlers that do nothing, handlers that only log to console, partial handlers missing implementation, and noop callbacks left behind during development.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to find empty onClick/onSubmit/onChange handlers
- You want to identify handlers that only log to console
- You're looking for stub handlers with TODO/FIXME comments
- You need to find noop callbacks left behind during development
- You're cleaning up incomplete feature implementations

## How It Works

1. **Scans event handlers** - Finds all onClick, onSubmit, onChange, onError, etc. callbacks
2. **Checks body content** - Identifies handlers with empty, console-only, or stub bodies
3. **Detects patterns** - Looks for () => {}, () => console.log(), noop(), etc.
4. **Finds TODOs** - Identifies handlers with unimplemented TODO/FIXME comments
5. **Checks call chains** - Verifies that partial handlers actually do something
6. **Reports findings** - Lists dead handlers with context and suggested fixes

## Focus Areas

- **Empty handlers**: `onClick={() => {}}`, `onClick={noop}`
- **Console-only handlers**: `onChange={e => console.log(e)}`
- **Partial handlers**: Handlers that start but don't complete work
- **Noop callbacks**: `() => null`, `() => undefined`, `() => {}`
- **TODO stub handlers**: `onClick={() => { // TODO: implement }}`

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep

## Example Analysis

Given React components with dead handlers:
```jsx
// Empty handler
<button onClick={() => {}}>Delete User</button>

// Console-only handler
<input onChange={e => console.log(e.target.value)} placeholder="Search..." />

// TODO stub handler
<form onSubmit={() => { // TODO: implement payment processing }}>
  <button>Pay Now</button>
</form>

// Partial handler
<button onClick={async () => {
  // Missing implementation - only shows success message
  showSuccessMessage("Item updated!");
  // But doesn't actually update anything
}}>
  Update Item
</button>
```

The Dead Handler analyzer would identify:

### Finding: Empty delete button handler

**Location**: `src/components/UserList.tsx:145`
**Severity**: P1 (feature broken)
**Confidence**: HIGH

**Issue**: Delete button has empty handler `() => {}`. Button click does nothing. User expects item to be deleted.

**Code**:
```jsx
<button onClick={() => {}}>Delete User</button>
```

**Impact**: Users cannot delete items. Feature appears to work but has no effect.

**Suggested Fix**: Implement the delete handler

```jsx
<button onClick={() => deleteUser(user.id)}>Delete User</button>
```

### Finding: Console-only search input handler

**Location**: `src/components/SearchBar.tsx:32`
**Severity**: P2 (partial implementation)
**Confidence**: HIGH

**Issue**: Search input only logs to console. Search doesn't actually filter results.

**Code**:
```jsx
<input
  onChange={e => console.log(e.target.value)}
  placeholder="Search..."
/>
```

**Impact**: Search appears to work (logs show activity) but users don't see filtered results.

**Suggested Fix**: Connect handler to state and filter logic

```jsx
<input
  onChange={e => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
  placeholder="Search..."
/>
```

### Finding: TODO stub in payment form

**Location**: `src/components/PaymentForm.tsx:78`
**Severity**: P0 (critical - payment doesn't work)
**Confidence**: HIGH

**Issue**: Submit handler has TODO comment and no implementation. Users who click "Pay Now" are charged but payment is never processed.

**Code**:
```jsx
<form onSubmit={() => {
  // TODO: implement payment processing
}}>
```

**Impact**: User payment feature is non-functional. Money might be lost.

**Suggested Fix**: Implement payment processing

```jsx
<form onSubmit={async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const result = await processPayment(formData);
  // Handle success/error
}}>
```

### Finding: Partial update handler without persistence

**Location**: `src/components/EditItem.tsx:92`
**Severity**: P1 (wrong result)
**Confidence**: HIGH

**Issue**: Update button shows success message but doesn't actually update the item. Changes are only in UI, not persisted.

**Code**:
```jsx
<button onClick={async () => {
  showSuccessMessage("Item updated!");
}}>
  Update Item
</button>
```

**Impact**: Users think item is updated, but changes are lost when page refreshes.

**Suggested Fix**: Call API before showing success

```jsx
<button onClick={async () => {
  await updateItem(itemId, formData);
  showSuccessMessage("Item updated!");
}}>
  Update Item
</button>
```

## Best Practices

- Every event handler should have real implementation (no empty handlers)
- Avoid console-only handlers in production code
- Complete TODO/FIXME handlers before committing
- Use TypeScript to catch unimplemented handlers
- Test all button clicks and form submissions
- Document complex handler logic with comments

## Output Format

For each finding, the agent provides:
- **Location**: File path and line number
- **Type**: Empty, console-only, partial, or stub handler
- **Severity**: P0 (feature broken), P1 (incomplete feature), or P2 (minor issue)
- **Confidence**: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW
- **Code**: Exact handler code
- **Issue**: What doesn't work and user impact
- **Suggested Fix**: How to implement properly

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Find empty event handlers in checkout flow",
  prompt: "Scan src/components/ for event handlers with empty bodies, console-only implementations, or TODO comments. Focus on onClick, onSubmit, onChange handlers.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-completeness-analyzer-handlers"
)
```
