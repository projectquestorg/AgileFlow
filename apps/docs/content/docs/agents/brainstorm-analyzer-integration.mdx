# Integration Opportunities

The Brainstorm Analyzer: Integration Opportunities agent is a specialized integration analyzer focused on **identifying third-party integrations, API extensibility, and data portability features the app should have**. It analyzes what services and data flows are missing that would make the app more useful and connected.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You need to identify missing auth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- You're looking for missing service integrations (email, storage, analytics)
- You want to check for missing data import/export features
- You need to find missing API or webhook extensibility
- You're analyzing payment/billing integration gaps
- You want to identify missing communication channel integrations

## How It Works

1. **Audits current integrations** - Scans package.json, environment files, and configuration for existing integrations
2. **Determines missing integrations** - Identifies which integrations would be valuable based on what the app does
3. **Assesses integration value** - Evaluates which integrations would have the most impact
4. **Provides specific recommendations** - Suggests exact services and implementation approaches

## Focus Areas

- **Missing auth providers**: No Google/GitHub/Apple sign-in where expected
- **Missing service integrations**: No email (SendGrid), no storage (S3), no analytics (Mixpanel)
- **Missing data portability**: No import from competitors, no export to common formats
- **Missing API/webhook extensibility**: No public API, no webhooks, no plugin system
- **Missing payment/billing**: No Stripe/PayPal where monetization is implied
- **Missing communication channels**: No Slack/Discord/email integrations

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep

## Output Format

For each integration opportunity, the agent provides:
- **Location**: Relevant file(s) showing where integration would connect
- **Category**: AUTH_PROVIDER, SERVICE, DATA_PORTABILITY, API_EXTENSIBILITY, PAYMENT, or COMMUNICATION
- **Value**: HIGH_VALUE, MEDIUM_VALUE, or NICE_TO_HAVE
- **Effort**: SMALL (hours), MEDIUM (days), or LARGE (weeks)
- **Current State**: What integration exists today, if any
- **Missing Integration**: What service/feature should be added
- **User Impact**: How users are affected without the integration
- **Suggested Service**: Specific service recommendation with rationale
- **Implementation Hint**: Brief approach and relevant libraries/SDKs

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Identify integration opportunities for SaaS application",
  prompt: "Analyze the codebase for missing third-party integrations. Check for missing auth providers, email services, payment processing, webhooks, and data portability features.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-brainstorm-analyzer-integration"
)
```
