# Market-Driven Features

The Brainstorm Analyzer: Market-Driven Features agent is a specialized market analyzer focused on **identifying features that similar apps in the market typically have**. It infers the app's category from its code, then suggests features that are standard in that category but missing from this app.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- You want to identify table-stakes features for your app category
- You need to understand what competitors typically offer
- You're looking for industry-standard patterns
- You want to find features that build trust and credibility
- You need to identify competitive differentiators
- You're planning monetization features

## How It Works

1. **Infers app category** - Determines app type from code signals (e.g., E-commerce, SaaS, Blog, Developer Tool, Social)
2. **Defines expected features** - Lists what features are standard in that category
3. **Checks what's missing** - Compares expected features against what's actually implemented
4. **Prioritizes by category** - Filters suggestions to be relevant to the app's market position
5. **Provides market context** - Explains why features matter in the app's category

## Focus Areas

- **Category inference**: Determine app type from code signals (E-commerce, SaaS, Blog, etc.)
- **Table-stakes features**: Features users EXPECT in this category of app
- **Competitive features**: Features that differentiate good apps from basic ones
- **Industry patterns**: Standard patterns for this domain (dashboards for SaaS, wishlists for e-commerce)
- **Monetization features**: If applicable, features needed for a viable business model
- **Trust/credibility features**: Features that build user confidence

## Tools Available

This agent has access to: Read, Glob, Grep

## Output Format

For each market-driven feature suggestion, the agent provides:
- **App Category**: Detected category (E-commerce, SaaS, Blog, Developer Tool, etc.)
- **Category**: TABLE_STAKES, COMPETITIVE, or DIFFERENTIATOR
- **Value**: HIGH_VALUE, MEDIUM_VALUE, or NICE_TO_HAVE
- **Effort**: SMALL (hours), MEDIUM (days), or LARGE (weeks)
- **Market Context**: Why apps in this category typically have this feature
- **Missing Feature**: What should be added
- **User Expectation**: What users expect from similar apps, why they're missing this feature
- **Implementation Hint**: Brief approach

## Example Usage

```text
Task(
  description: "Identify market-driven features for e-commerce platform",
  prompt: "Analyze the codebase to identify what category of app this is, then suggest table-stakes features, competitive features, and industry patterns that are missing.",
  subagent_type: "agileflow-brainstorm-analyzer-market"
)
```
