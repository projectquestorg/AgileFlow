# Ads Consensus

Consensus coordinator for the Paid Advertising Audit system that collects findings from all ads analyzers, weights them by category, aggregates into an Ads Health Score (0-100), classifies by industry, and produces the final prioritized Ads Audit Report.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:

- Running a full multi-platform advertising audit via `/agileflow:ads:audit`
- You need to synthesize findings from multiple analyzers
- You want a weighted Ads Health Score across all platforms
- You need to prioritize which issues to fix first
- You want industry-specific recommendations
- You need to identify cross-platform issues flagged by multiple analyzers

## How It Works

1. **Classifies Industry Type**: Detects SaaS, E-commerce, Local Services, B2B, Healthcare, etc.
2. **Collects Findings**: Parses all 6 analyzer outputs into normalized structure
3. **Calculates Category Scores**: Applies severity deductions (CRITICAL -15, HIGH -8, MEDIUM -4, LOW -2)
4. **Weights by Category**: Tracking 25%, Wasted Spend 20%, Structure 15%, Creative 15%, Budget 15%, Compliance 10%
5. **Enforces Quality Gates**: Non-negotiable rules that override scoring
6. **Cross-References Issues**: Identifies problems flagged by multiple analyzers
7. **Prioritizes by Impact**: Critical → High → Medium → Low
8. **Generates Report**: Final Ads Audit Report with action plan

## Focus Areas

**Category Weights in Overall Score**:
- **Conversion Tracking (25%)** - Foundation of all optimization
- **Wasted Spend (20%)** - Money being burned inefficiently
- **Account Structure (15%)** - Organization and campaign setup
- **Creative Quality (15%)** - Ad asset effectiveness
- **Budget & Bidding (15%)** - Spend allocation and strategy
- **Compliance (10%)** - Policy and regulatory adherence

## Ads Health Score Grades

| Grade | Score | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| A | 90-100 | Excellent - well-optimized accounts |
| B | 80-89 | Good - minor optimization opportunities |
| C | 70-79 | Needs Work - significant improvements available |
| D | 60-69 | Poor - major issues affecting performance |
| F | \<60 | Critical - fundamental problems, likely losing money |

## Quality Gates (Override Scoring)

1. **No tracking** - Caps score at 30, adds CRITICAL banner
2. **No conversion data** - Flags automated bidding as unreliable
3. **Broad without Smart Bidding** - Flags as CRITICAL waste
4. **3x Kill Rule** - Campaigns with CPA > 3x target flagged for immediate pause
5. **Compliance violation** - Flagged as CRITICAL regardless of score
6. **Learning phase violations** - Flagged as HIGH risk
