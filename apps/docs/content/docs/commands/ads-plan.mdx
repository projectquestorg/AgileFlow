# /ads:plan

Generate a comprehensive paid advertising campaign plan with industry-specific templates, platform recommendations, budget allocation, and timeline.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ads:plan                                     # Interactive planning (recommended)
/agileflow:ads:plan INDUSTRY=saas BUDGET=5000           # Direct with parameters
/agileflow:ads:plan INDUSTRY=ecommerce GOAL=roas        # E-commerce with ROAS goal
```

## How It Works

1. **Discover your business** - Interactive questions about industry, goal, budget
2. **Select platforms** - Recommendations based on industry and budget
3. **Generate campaign plan** - Industry-specific structure with allocation
4. **Create timeline** - Week-by-week launch schedule
5. **Define KPIs** - Metrics to track and targets to hit
6. **Set scaling rules** - How to grow budget without wasting spend

## Step 1: Interactive Discovery

If you don't provide parameters, the plan will ask:

**Industry**: SaaS, E-commerce, Local Services, B2B, Healthcare, Education, Finance, Real Estate

**Goal**: Lead generation, ROAS/Sales, Brand awareness, App installs

**Budget**: $1K-$5K, $5K-$20K, $20K-$100K, $100K+

## Step 2: Platform Selection

Based on your industry and budget, the plan recommends specific platforms:

| Industry | Recommended (Primary) | Secondary | Avoid |
|----------|----------------------|-----------|-------|
| SaaS | Google + Meta | LinkedIn | TikTok |
| E-commerce | Google + Meta | TikTok | LinkedIn |
| Local Services | Google + Meta | Microsoft | LinkedIn |
| B2B | LinkedIn + Google | Meta | TikTok |
| Healthcare | Google + Meta | LinkedIn | TikTok |

## Step 4: Budget Allocation Matrix

| Monthly Budget | Platform Allocation | Breakdown |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| $1K-5K | 1-2 platforms | 70% primary / 30% secondary |
| $5K-20K | 2-3 platforms | 50% / 30% / 20% |
| $20K-100K | 3-4 platforms | 40% / 25% / 20% / 15% |
| $100K+ | 4-6 platforms | Proportional to ROAS |

Within each platform:
- **70%** - Proven campaigns (known performers)
- **20%** - Testing (new audiences, creatives)
- **10%** - Experimental (new platforms, formats)

## Step 5: Launch Timeline

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- [ ] Set up conversion tracking on all platforms
- [ ] Create audiences and upload customer lists
- [ ] Build campaign structures (campaigns, ad groups, ad sets)
- [ ] Design landing pages (or prepare Lead Gen Forms)

### Week 3-4: Launch
- [ ] Launch brand campaigns first (low risk, baseline traffic)
- [ ] Activate retargeting (from any existing traffic)
- [ ] Begin prospecting with proven audiences
- [ ] Monitor for technical issues (tracking, etc.)

### Month 2: Optimize
- [ ] Review search terms, add negatives
- [ ] Identify winning and losing creatives
- [ ] Adjust bids based on early data
- [ ] Pause underperformers

### Month 3: Scale
- [ ] Scale winners (max 20% budget increase/week)
- [ ] Pause underperformers (3x Kill Rule)
- [ ] Test new audiences and creatives
- [ ] Set up automated rules and alerts

## Step 6: KPIs & Targets

Example KPIs by industry:

### SaaS
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| CPL (MQL) | $50-150 |
| CPL (SQL) | $150-400 |
| Trial-to-Paid | 15-25% |
| ROAS (12mo LTV) | 5:1+ |

### E-commerce
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| ROAS | 3:1-5:1 |
| CPA (Purchase) | <$30-80 |
| AOV:CPA | >3:1 |
| Cart abandonment recovery | 10-15% |

### Local Services
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| CPL | $15-50 |
| Cost per call | $20-60 |
| Booking rate | 25-40% |
| Customer LTV:CPA | >5:1 |

## Step 7: Scaling Rules

1. **Only scale proven campaigns** - 3+ weeks of data minimum
2. **Max 20% increase per week** - Gradual growth prevents waste
3. **3x Kill Rule** - Pause if CPA > 3x target
4. **Don't scale and test simultaneously** - Separate concerns
5. **Monitor learning phase** - No changes during ramp-up
