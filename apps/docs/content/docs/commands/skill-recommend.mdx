|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<keyword>` | No | Filter recommendations by keyword (optional) |

## Usage Examples

### View all recommendations

```bash
/agileflow:skill:recommend
```

Analyze your project dependencies and show matching skills by category.

### Filter by keyword

```bash
/agileflow:skill:recommend react
```

Show recommended skills matching "react" in name, description, or tags.

### Search for specific technology

```bash
/agileflow:skill:recommend testing
```

Find skills related to testing frameworks and tools.

### Step 1: Tech Stack Detection

Reads `package.json` and scans for project files:

- **Node/JavaScript**: package.json dependencies
- **Python**: requirements.txt, pyproject.toml
- **Go**: go.mod
- **PHP**: composer.json
- **DevOps**: Dockerfile, terraform/, k8s/
- **CI/CD**: .github/workflows/

### Step 2: Skill Matching

Scores each skill in the curated catalog based on how many of the skill's tags match your detected stack.

### Step 3: Filter Installed

Checks `.claude/skills/` and excludes skills already installed.

### Step 4: Display by Category

Shows recommendations grouped by category with relevance percentage.

### Step 5: Install Commands

Each skill shows the exact `npx skills add` command for installation.

## Skill Categories

The curated catalog (~60 skills) is organized in 6 categories:

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Frontend** | 13 | React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Tailwind, TypeScript |
| **Backend** | 11 | GraphQL, Express, FastAPI, Node.js, Go, microservices |
| **Database** | 8 | Prisma, Supabase, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, Drizzle |
| **Testing** | 10 | TDD, Jest, Playwright, Cypress, pytest, Vitest |
| **DevOps** | 9 | GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Vercel |
| **Security** | 8 | OWASP, code review, auth, input validation |

## When to Use

Use skill recommendations for:

- Discovering skills matching your tech stack
- Finding best practices for frameworks you use
- Learning patterns for testing tools
- Setting up DevOps automation
- Finding security audit skills

## Error Handling

### No package.json Found

```
Could not detect tech stack (no package.json found).
You can still browse the marketplace:
  npx skills find
  npx skills search <your-technology>
```

### No Matches Found

```
No curated skills match your tech stack.
Try searching the marketplace:
  npx skills search <your-technology>
  npx skills find
```

## Installing a Skill

Once you see a recommended skill, install it with:

```bash
npx skills add vercel/next-skills
```

After installation, the skill appears in `.claude/skills/` and is automatically excluded from future recommendations.

## Broader Search

For skills beyond the curated catalog, use the live marketplace:

```bash
npx skills search <keyword>
```

Or browse all available skills:

```bash
npx skills find
```
