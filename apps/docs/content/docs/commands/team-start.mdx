# /team:start

Start a multi-agent team from a template. The team lead coordinates specialized teammates working in parallel on complex tasks.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:team:start fullstack
```

## How It Works

1. Detects whether Claude Code native Agent Teams is enabled (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`)
2. Loads the specified template from `.agileflow/teams/`
3. In **native mode**: operates as team lead in delegate mode, spawning independent teammate sessions with file-locking
4. In **fallback mode**: uses the orchestrator subagent to coordinate experts within a single session

## Available Templates

| Template | Description | Teammates |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `fullstack` | Full-stack feature development | API builder, UI builder, Testing validator |
| `code-review` | Multi-perspective code review | Code reviewer, Security, Performance |
| `builder-validator` | Paired build and verify | API + API validator, UI + UI validator |
| `logic-audit` | Deep logic analysis | Edge, Flow, Invariant, Race, Type analyzers |

## Usage

```bash
# Start a full-stack team
/agileflow:team:start fullstack

# Start a code review team
/agileflow:team:start code-review

# Start a custom team
/agileflow:team:start my-custom-template
```

## Quality Gates

Each template includes quality gate configuration that enforces standards before work is accepted:

- **Tests passing**: Required before teammate can go idle
- **Lint passing**: Configurable per template
- **Type checking**: Optional per template
- **Validator approval**: Required for builder-validator teams
