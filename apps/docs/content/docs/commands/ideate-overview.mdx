# /discovery

Comprehensive discovery system for validating product ideas, gathering requirements, and generating professional Product Briefs before implementation.

## Quick Start

The discovery system provides two specialized commands:

```bash
/discovery:new TOPIC="your product idea"                    # Complete discovery workflow
/discovery:brief TOPIC="..." IDEATION=... RESEARCH=...      # Generate brief from existing files
```

## Overview

The discovery system enables:

1. **Validate ideas before implementation** - Run structured analysis on features and products
2. **Gather insights from multiple perspectives** - Deploy domain experts (security, performance, UX, etc.)
3. **Research market and competitive landscape** - Understand market context
4. **Generate professional Product Briefs** - Create artifacts ready for epic planning
5. **Bridge from idea to implementation** - Structured path from vague idea to detailed stories

Discovery is essential for:

- **New features** - Is it worth building? How should it work?
- **Major products** - What's the market opportunity? What's competitive?
- **Architecture decisions** - What are the tradeoffs? What could go wrong?
- **MVP planning** - What's the minimum viable set of features?
- **Stakeholder alignment** - Clear, shared understanding before development

## Subcommands

### /discovery:new - Complete Discovery Workflow

Run a full structured discovery process that orchestrates brainstorming, optional research, and Product Brief generation.

**Purpose**: Bridge gap between vague idea and epic planning with validated requirements.

## Workflow Example: From Idea to Implementation

```
Step 1: Discover
  /discovery:new TOPIC="Mobile Time Tracking App" DEPTH=guided
  ↓
  Output: docs/08-project/briefs/20250214-mobile-time-tracking-app-brief.md

Step 2: Review Brief
  cat docs/08-project/briefs/20250214-mobile-time-tracking-app-brief.md
  ↓
  Validated features with MoSCoW prioritization

Step 3: Create Epic
  /epic EP-0123 TITLE="Mobile Time Tracking App" \
    GOAL="Reduce timesheet creation from 30 min to 2 min" \
    RESEARCH=docs/08-project/briefs/20250214-mobile-time-tracking-app-brief.md
  ↓
  Epic ready for decomposition

Step 4: Create Stories
  /story US-0001 TITLE="Basic Timer" EPIC=EP-0123
  /story US-0002 TITLE="Project Selection" EPIC=EP-0123
  /story US-0003 TITLE="Export to Invoice" EPIC=EP-0123
  ↓
  Stories ready for assignment

Step 5: Implement
  /assign STORY=US-0001 NEW_OWNER=claude
  /babysit EPIC=EP-0123
  ↓
  Implementation with guided mentoring
```

## Discovery Phases

### Phase 1: Brainstorm (via /ideate:new)

Deploy domain experts to analyze your codebase:

- **Security Expert** - Security features, compliance requirements
- **Performance Expert** - Scalability, optimization opportunities
- **Code Quality Expert** - Maintainability, refactoring opportunities
- **UX Expert** - User experience, accessibility improvements
- **Testing Expert** - Test coverage, reliability requirements
- **API Expert** - API design, integration patterns

Each expert generates ideas with confidence scores.

### Phase 2: Research (optional in quick mode)

Investigate external context:

- **Market analysis** - Is there demand? Market size?
- **Competitive features** - What do competitors offer?
- **Technical feasibility** - Can we build it? What are tradeoffs?
- **User research** - What do actual users want?
- **Best practices** - How do others solve similar problems?

Use `/research:ask` to generate detailed research prompts for external AI tools.

### Phase 3: Synthesis (via /discovery:brief)

Convert findings into Product Brief:

1. Extract feature ideas and confidence scores
2. Cross-reference with research validation
3. Group related ideas
4. Assign MoSCoW priorities (MUST/SHOULD/COULD/WON'T)
5. Estimate effort (High/Medium/Low)
6. Generate professional document

## Output Structure

Discovery produces a **Product Brief** with:

```
docs/08-project/briefs/{YYYYMMDD}-{topic-slug}-brief.md
```

### Brief Sections

1. **Executive Summary** - Problem, value proposition, success criteria
2. **User Personas** - Who we're building for
3. **Features with MoSCoW Prioritization**:
   - **MUST HAVE** - High confidence (2+ experts), build first
   - **SHOULD HAVE** - Medium confidence (1 expert, validated), build next
   - **COULD HAVE** - Low confidence, build if capacity
   - **WON'T HAVE** - Explicitly out of scope
4. **Success Metrics** - How we measure success
5. **Business Case** - ROI, strategic value, competitive advantage
6. **Risks & Mitigation** - Known challenges and solutions
7. **Next Steps** - Path to epic creation and implementation

## Depth Modes Explained

### Quick (5-10 minutes)

**When to use**: Well-scoped features, iterations, minor changes

```bash
/discovery:new TOPIC="Add dark mode toggle" DEPTH=quick
```

**Process**:
1. Auto-run brainstorming (6 experts, quick analysis)
2. Skip research phase
3. Generate brief immediately

**Output**: Feature list with expert perspectives, no market research

**Example**: Dark mode, CSV export, new dashboard view

---

### Guided (30-45 minutes) - Recommended

**When to use**: New features, moderate uncertainty, standard development

```bash
/discovery:new TOPIC="OAuth integration" DEPTH=guided
```

**Process**:
1. Interactive brainstorming (you select scope and depth)
2. Optional research (system asks if you want to research)
3. Review expert findings
4. Curate features before brief generation
5. Generate brief

**Output**: Curated Product Brief with research context

**Example**: New authentication system, payment processing, analytics dashboard

---

### Deep (2+ hours)

**When to use**: Major products, architectural changes, significant investment

```bash
/discovery:new TOPIC="Microservices migration" DEPTH=deep
```

**Process**:
1. Comprehensive brainstorming (6 experts, detailed analysis)
2. Multi-stage research (market, competitive, technical)
3. Synthesize all findings
4. Detailed brief with competitive positioning

**Output**: Comprehensive Product Brief with market context

**Example**: Platform rewrite, new service offering, major architecture change

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose Appropriate Depth

Balance thoroughness with speed:

```bash
# Quick for routine changes
/discovery:new TOPIC="Fix login bug" DEPTH=quick

# Guided for new features (recommended)
/discovery:new TOPIC="Export to PDF" DEPTH=guided

# Deep for major decisions
/discovery:new TOPIC="Database migration to PostgreSQL" DEPTH=deep
```

### 2. Include Research for Validation

Combine brainstorming with research:

```bash
/discovery:new TOPIC="Mobile app" DEPTH=guided
# System will ask if you want to research
# Say yes to validate ideas
```

### 3. Iterate on Briefs

Briefs improve with feedback:

```bash
# Initial discovery
/discovery:new TOPIC="Feature X" DEPTH=quick

# Get feedback from team
# Additional research

# Refine brief
/discovery:brief TOPIC="Feature X" RESEARCH=docs/10-research/feedback.md
```

### 4. Use Brief as Epic Reference

Link epic to brief for traceability:

```bash
/epic EP-0001 TITLE="Feature X" \
  RESEARCH=docs/08-project/briefs/20250214-feature-x-brief.md
```

This preserves context about why features were prioritized.
