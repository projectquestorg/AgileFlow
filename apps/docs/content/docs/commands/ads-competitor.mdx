# /ads:competitor

Analyze your competitive landscape for paid advertising. Identify competitor ad strategies, messaging positioning, market gaps you can exploit, and strategic recommendations.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ads:competitor "SaaS project management"      # Industry research
/agileflow:ads:competitor "Asana, Monday.com, Jira"      # Specific competitors
```

## What It Analyzes

For each competitor, analyzes:

| Factor | What We Look For | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Ad copy themes | Headlines, CTAs, value props | Reveals messaging they're testing |
| Landing pages | Page structure, offers, forms | Shows conversion optimization strategy |
| Platforms active | Google, Meta, LinkedIn, etc. | Tells you where they're investing |
| Offer positioning | Free trial, discount, demo | Reveals their go-to-market strategy |
| Audience signals | Targeting demographics, interests | Shows who they prioritize |
| Creative style | Video, UGC, professional | Indicates what resonates with their audience |

## Output

You receive:
- **Competitor overview table** - Platforms, key messages, offers, ad style
- **Messaging gaps** - Where competitors are NOT messaging (opportunities for you)
- **Ad format gaps** - Ad types/platforms competitors aren't using
- **Positioning recommendations** - How to differentiate from competitors
- **Suggested ad copy angles** - Specific headlines exploiting competitive gaps
- **Underserved keywords** - Keyword areas competitors miss

## Account Data Needed

Specify either:
- **Industry keyword** - "SaaS project management", "e-commerce platform", "local plumber software"
- **Competitor names** - "Asana, Monday.com, Jira", "Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce"
- **Combination** - "project management tools like Asana and Monday.com"

## Example Output Structure

## Competitive Intelligence Report

### Competitor Overview
| Competitor | Platforms | Key Message | Offer | Ad Style |
| Asana | Google, Meta, LinkedIn | Enterprise work OS | Free trial | Professional |
| Monday | Google, Meta | Visual project management | Demo | Energetic/playful |

### Messaging Gaps
- Nobody emphasizes quick setup (opportunity)
- No one focuses on small team affordability
- None highlight integration ecosystem heavily

### Ad Format Gaps
- YouTube video ads barely used (opportunity)
- TikTok not present (audience mismatch)
- LinkedIn document ads rare

### Positioning Recommendations
1. **Differentiate on**: Quick 5-minute setup (vs complex onboarding)
2. **Counter-position**: For small teams (\<10 people) vs enterprise
3. **Underserved keywords**: "project management for remote teams", "no-code alternatives"

### Suggested Ad Copy Angles
- "Set up in 5 minutes, not 5 weeks" - Why: competitors emphasize features, not speed
- "For small teams that outgrew email" - Why: nobody targeting SMBs specifically
- "Integrates with your existing tools" - Why: emphasize ecosystem lock-in
```

## When to Use

- **New product launch** - Understand competitive positioning before market entry
- **Campaign planning** - Use gaps to inform strategy
- **Messaging testing** - Test competitive angles before running ads
- **Market entry** - Understand positioning before expanding to new vertical
- **Quarterly review** - Monitor competitor strategy changes

## Example Usage

### Industry Research
```bash
/agileflow:ads:competitor "SaaS project management tools"
# Returns: Top competitors, their strategies, and positioning gaps
```

### Specific Competitors
```bash
/agileflow:ads:competitor "Asana, Monday.com, Jira Cloud"
# Returns: Detailed comparison of these three competitors
```

### Market Positioning
```bash
/agileflow:ads:competitor "e-commerce platform for restaurants"
# Returns: Who's advertising in this space and what messages work
```

## Next Steps After Analysis

1. **Review findings** - Understand competitive positioning
2. **Identify your angle** - Pick one or two gaps to exploit
3. **Test messaging** - A/B test ad copy exploiting gaps
4. **Build campaigns** - Use `/agileflow:ads:plan` with competitive insights
5. **Monitor competitors** - Rerun quarterly to track strategy changes

## Tips

- **Focus on 3-5 competitors** - Too many dilutes the analysis
- **Look for patterns** - What are ALL competitors saying? (probably table stakes)
- **Find the opposite** - Underserved angles beat doing what competitors do
- **Combine with your strengths** - Gaps + your unique value = winning positioning
- **Test first** - Validate positioning with ads before major campaigns
