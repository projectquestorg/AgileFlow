# /research:synthesize

Analyze multiple research notes together to find consensus, conflicts, unique insights, and technology patterns across your research.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:research:synthesize TOPIC="authentication patterns"
```

Or specify files directly:

```bash
/agileflow:research:synthesize FILES="20260115-oauth-research.md,20260120-jwt-comparison.md"
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TOPIC=<text>` | Find and synthesize research files matching this topic |
| `FILES=<list>` | Comma-separated list of specific research files to analyze |

## How It Works

1. **Input validation** - Requires either TOPIC or FILES
2. **File selection** - Finds matching research files and confirms selection
3. **Metadata extraction** - Pulls key findings, technologies, and recommendations from each file
4. **Synthesis analysis** - Cross-references findings using confidence scoring
5. **Report generation** - Produces a structured synthesis report

## Confidence Scoring

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **HIGH** | Finding appears in 2+ research files (consensus) |
| **UNIQUE** | Finding appears in only 1 file (needs verification) |
| **CONFLICT** | Files disagree on a finding (requires resolution) |

## Report Sections

- **Files Analyzed** - Source research notes
- **Consensus Findings** - High-confidence findings from multiple sources
- **Unique Insights** - Single-source findings worth verifying
- **Conflicts Detected** - Disagreements flagged for review
- **Technology Patterns** - Common technologies and approaches
- **Timeline** - Chronological view of research progression
