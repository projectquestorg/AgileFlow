Deep analysis of a single page across 6 SEO dimensions. More thorough than the full-site audit for individual pages.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:seo:page https://example.com/about              # Full 6-dimension analysis
/agileflow:seo:page https://example.com/blog/post FOCUS=content   # Content quality only
/agileflow:seo:page https://example.com/product FOCUS=schema      # Schema markup only
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `<URL>` | Yes | - | Page to analyze |
| `FOCUS` | No | all | all, on-page, content, technical, schema, images, or performance |

## 6 Analysis Dimensions

### 1. On-Page SEO
Fundamental elements that Google and users see:
- Title tag (30-60 chars, keyword-forward)
- Meta description (120-160 chars, has CTA)
- H1 tag (exactly 1, unique per page)
- Heading hierarchy (H2-H6 logical structure)
- Internal links (2-10 per page, descriptive anchors)
- External links (authoritative sources)
- URL structure (clean, keyword-relevant)
- Canonical tag (self-referencing or correct target)
- Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image)

### 2. Content Quality
Using the E-E-A-T framework:
- Word count vs page type minimum
- Content uniqueness (not boilerplate)
- Readability level and structure
- Author attribution and credentials
- E-E-A-T signals present
- AI citation readiness (134-167 word blocks)

### 3. Technical
Page-level technical checks:
- HTTP status code
- TTFB (server response time)
- HTTPS enabled
- Mobile viewport meta tag
- Canonical tag correctness
- Robots directives (index/noindex)
- Structured data presence
- Language declaration

### 4. Schema
Structured data for rich results:
- Existing JSON-LD/Microdata/RDFa
- Validation against Google standards
- Missing schema opportunities for page type
- Rich result eligibility
- Deprecated type flagging

### 5. Images
All images on the page:
- Alt text quality (descriptive, 10-125 chars)
- Width/height attributes (CLS prevention)
- Format (WebP/AVIF vs legacy JPEG/PNG)
- Lazy loading (below-fold images)
- LCP image optimization
- Responsive images (srcset/sizes)

### 6. Performance
Page-level performance indicators:
- Render-blocking resources
- Script loading (async/defer)
