# /council

Convene an AI Council for strategic decisions. Three perspectives (Optimist, Devil's Advocate, Neutral Analyst) deliberate in parallel to provide balanced, high-quality recommendations.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:council Should we adopt microservices architecture?
```

Three council members analyze the question and provide recommendations.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<question>` | Yes | Strategic question to deliberate |
| `--mode` | No | `parallel` (default) or `debate` |
| `--rounds` | No | Number of rounds for debate mode (1-3) |

## Usage Examples

### Basic decision - parallel mode

```bash
/agileflow:council Should we migrate to microservices?
```

All three perspectives analyze once and synthesize.

### Debate mode - multiple rounds

```bash
/agileflow:council --mode debate --rounds 2 Is GraphQL better than REST for our API?
```

Council members respond to each other's perspectives.

### With full parameters

```bash
/agileflow:council --mode debate --rounds 3 Should we adopt feature flags?
```

## Council Members

The council has three members with different perspectives:

| Role | Focus | Strength |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Optimist** | Best-case scenarios, opportunities, success pathways | Finds what's possible |
| **Devil's Advocate** | Risks, blind spots, stress-testing assumptions | Prevents blind spots |
| **Neutral Analyst** | Trade-offs, evidence synthesis, decision criteria | Grounds decisions |

Together, they produce balanced, high-quality recommendations.

## When to Use

Use the AI Council for **strategic, non-technical decisions** where balanced perspectives matter:

### Good For

- Architecture decisions: "Should we adopt microservices?"
- Technology choices: "GraphQL vs REST for our API?"
- Process decisions: "Should we implement feature flags?"
- Business tradeoffs: "Build vs buy for this feature?"
- Strategy questions: "Should we prioritize mobile or web?"

### Not For

- Code implementation (use domain experts)
- Simple questions with clear answers
- Tasks requiring codebase changes
- Research tasks (use `/agileflow:research:ask`)

## Output Format

### Perspectives Section

Each council member provides:

**Optimist Strategist**:
- Key opportunities (at least 3)
- Success pathways
- Enablers in the system

**Devil's Advocate**:
- Key risks with mitigations
- Blind spots and assumptions
- Stress tests and edge cases

**Neutral Analyst**:
- Evidence summary (for and against)
- Trade-off analysis
- Decision criteria

### Synthesis Section

The council synthesis includes:

```markdown
## AI Council Deliberation

**Question**: Should we migrate to microservices?
**Session**: [timestamp]
**Mode**: parallel

### Perspectives

#### Optimist Strategist
Key opportunities:
- Independent scaling per service
- Technology flexibility
- Team autonomy and faster releases

#### Devil's Advocate
Critical concerns:
- Distributed systems complexity
- Network latency overhead
- Operational burden

#### Neutral Analyst
Trade-offs:
| Factor | For | Against | Weight |
|--------|-----|---------|--------|
| Scaling | Independent | Network overhead | High |
| Ops | Flexibility | Complexity | High |

### Synthesis

#### Common Ground (High Confidence)
All 3 council members agree:
- Current monolith pain points are real
- Incremental approach reduces risk

#### Opportunities (Optimist Unique)
- Independent team velocity

#### Risks to Monitor (Advocate Unique)
- Operational burden without proper tooling

#### Key Trade-offs
- Scalability vs. operational complexity

### Recommendation

**Decision**: Start with one bounded context migration

**Confidence**: 75%

**Rationale**: [explanation of why this recommendation is best]
```

## Modes

### Parallel Mode (Default)

All three council members analyze independently once, then results are synthesized.

```bash
/agileflow:council Should we migrate to microservices?
```

Best for:
- Quick decisions
- Well-defined questions
- Time-sensitive decisions

### Debate Mode

Multiple rounds where council members respond to each other's perspectives.

```bash
/agileflow:council --mode debate --rounds 2 Is GraphQL better than REST?
```

Process:
1. Round 1: Initial perspectives
2. Round 2: Responses and rebuttals
3. Final synthesis

Best for:
- Complex decisions needing deeper analysis
- Questions with significant trade-offs
- Strategic choices with high stakes

## Example Session

### Question

```
Should we migrate from monolith to microservices?
```

### Optimist's Perspective

```
Key opportunities:
1. Independent scaling per service
   - User service scales on demand
   - Payment service independent scaling
   - 40-50% reduction in infrastructure costs

2. Technology flexibility
   - Each service can use optimal technology
   - Python for data services, Go for API services

3. Team autonomy
   - Teams own full stack per service
   - Faster feature delivery
   - Reduced coordination overhead
```

### Advocate's Perspective

```
Critical concerns:
1. Distributed systems complexity (MITIGATE: Start with 1 service)
   - Network latency
   - Transaction coordination
   - Debugging distributed failures

2. Operational burden (MITIGATE: Invest in observability)
   - Multiple services to monitor
   - Service discovery and communication
   - Deployment complexity

3. Team readiness (MITIGATE: Training and phased rollout)
   - Few team members understand microservices
   - No experience with service mesh
```

### Analyst's Perspective

```
Trade-off analysis:
- Current pain: Monolith scaling issues, coordination overhead
- Proposed solution: Microservices addressing these directly
- New risks: Operational complexity (mitigable with tooling)
- Team capacity: Phased approach recommended

Decision criteria:
1. Can we migrate incrementally? (Yes)
2. Do we have operations expertise? (Partial - needs investment)
3. Will it solve current pain? (Yes)

Recommendation: Start with one bounded context
```

### Synthesis

```
Common Ground (All Agree):
- Current monolith has real pain points
- Incremental migration reduces risk
- Team needs training before full migration

Recommendation: Start with one bounded context (User Service)
- Proves microservices approach works
- Limits risk exposure
- Team gains experience for next migration
- 6-12 month timeline for full migration

Confidence: 75% (high pain points, mitigable risks, clear path)
```

## Integration with Other Commands

After council deliberation:

- **Document decision**: Use `/agileflow:adr` to create Architecture Decision Record
- **Create work**: Use `/agileflow:story` to create stories for implementation
- **Analyze impact**: Use `/agileflow:impact` to understand change impact
- **Implement**: Use `/agileflow:babysit` for orchestrated implementation

## Best Practices

1. **Ask specific questions** - Vague questions produce vague recommendations
2. **Provide context** - More context = better analysis
3. **Define success criteria** - What matters most?
4. **Use debate mode for complex decisions** - Let council members respond to each other
5. **Document decisions** - Create ADR for important strategic choices
