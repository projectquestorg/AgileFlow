# /ads:creative

Run a creative quality audit across all ad platforms using 21 deterministic checks for ad copy effectiveness, visual compliance, format coverage, and performance testing.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ads:creative <account-data>                # Cross-platform creative review
```

## What It Checks

The audit applies 21 checks across 4 categories:

| Category | Weight | Checks | Focus |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Ad Copy Effectiveness | 30% | 7 | Value prop, CTA, social proof, keyword alignment |
| Visual & Format Compliance | 25% | 6 | Resolution, text overlay, brand, mobile-first |
| Platform Requirements | 25% | 4 | Format coverage, native style, char limits, compliance |
| Performance & Testing | 20% | 4 | Diversity, winner ID, refresh cadence, A/B testing |

## Output

You receive:
- **Creative Score** (0-100)
- **Category breakdown** with individual scores
- **Specific findings** - What's working, what isn't
- **Compliance issues** - Format, character limit, restricted content violations
- **Performance assessment** - Creative diversity, refresh needs, testing methodology
- **Actionable improvements** - Specific creative enhancements

## Account Data Needed

Provide:
- Ad copy (headlines, descriptions, primary text)
- Creative assets (image specs, video details)
- Platform-specific formatting used
- Performance metrics (CTR, CPC, frequency)
- How often creatives are refreshed

Example format:
```
Google Ads Headlines:
- "Buy Our Product Today" (15 headlines total)
- "Free Trial for 30 Days"

Meta Ads Copy:
- 6 ad sets, 3 creatives each
- Images: 1200x628 all static
- Videos: None tested yet

Performance: CTR declining, frequency >3.5
```

## The 21 Checks Explained

### Ad Copy Effectiveness (7 checks)
- Clear value proposition in first headline
- Specific, compelling CTA (not just "Learn More")
- Social proof (numbers, testimonials, reviews)
- Urgency/scarcity for time-sensitive offers
- Keyword alignment in search ads
- Benefits emphasized over features
- Platform-appropriate length

### Visual & Format Compliance (6 checks)
- Image resolution meets platform minimums (1080x1080+)
- Text overlay < 20% of image area
- Brand consistency across ads
- Mobile-first design (80%+ impressions are mobile)
- Key elements within safe zones
- Video specs (duration, aspect ratio, file size)

### Platform-Specific Requirements (4 checks)
- Format coverage - All required formats (1:1, 4:5, 9:16, 16:9)
- Platform-native style - Doesn't look repurposed
- Character limits respected - All text within platform limits
- Restricted content compliance - No before/after, claims, etc.

### Performance & Testing (4 checks)
- Creative diversity - 3+ distinct concepts active
- Winner/loser identification - Clear thresholds to pause/scale
- Refresh cadence - New creatives within last 30 days
- A/B testing methodology - Controlled tests with one variable

## Example Usage

### Basic Creative Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:creative "Google Ads: 4 campaigns, 12 ad sets, 30 ads total. Mostly text ads, static images only. Using 'Click Here' CTAs. No video tested."
# Returns: Creative Score with specific improvement recommendations
```

### With Detailed Creative Data
```bash
/agileflow:ads:creative
# Paste detailed creative inventory with copy, specs, and performance
# Returns: Full creative audit with compliance and testing recommendations
```

## Expected Improvements

By implementing the recommendations:
- **10-20% improvement** in CTR through better copy and design
- **Reduced ad fatigue** through strategic refresh
- **Compliance** with all platform requirements
- **Better testing** with proper A/B methodology
- **Creative reusability** across platforms through format coverage

## Platform-Specific Tips

### Google Ads
- Responsive Search Ads (RSAs) need 10+ headlines and 3+ descriptions
- Use dynamic keyword insertion for relevance
- Ad extensions boost CTR (sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets)
- Test headline variations more than copy variations

### Meta
- Video outperforms static images (2-3x better CTR)
- 1:1 (square) format most common, but test 4:5 and 9:16 too
- UGC-style content often beats polished ads
- Native-feeling ads perform better than overly designed ones

### LinkedIn
- Longer copy (600 chars) gets more engagement than short
- Document Ads for thought leadership perform well
- Test professional vs casual tone
- B2B audiences respond to credibility signals

### TikTok
- Video-only (no static images)
- First 3 seconds critical (before scroll)
- Native TikTok style beats polished ads
- Captions essential (80%+ watch without sound)

## When to Run

- **Monthly** - Monitor creative health and refresh needs
- **After hypothesis testing** - Validate what's working before scaling
- **Before scaling budget** - Ensure creatives are strong before spending more
- **Quarterly review** - Comprehensive creative strategy assessment
- **After performance decline** - If CTR/CVR dropping, creative may be fatigued

## Tips

- **Fresh beats perfect** - A decent new creative often outperforms an old high performer
- **Test, don't guess** - Use data to decide what works, not assumptions
- **Platform matters** - What works on Meta won't work on LinkedIn
- **Mobile first** - Design for phones first, desktop second
- **Compliance first** - No amount of performance matters if ad disapproved
