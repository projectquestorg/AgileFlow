# /session:cleanup

Interactively clean up finished sessions with AI-powered assessment of each session's importance and merge eligibility.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:session:cleanup
```

## How It Works

1. Shows a detailed health report for all sessions
2. Walks through **each session with issues** one-by-one
3. AI assesses each session: **SAFE TO DELETE** vs **IMPORTANT - KEEP**
4. Checks merge eligibility for sessions with branches
5. Presents options based on assessment and merge status

## Assessment Options

| Scenario | Options Available |
|----------|-------------------|
| Safe + Mergeable | Delete, Merge and delete, Keep |
| Important + Mergeable | Merge and delete, Keep, Switch to session |
| Cannot merge (uncommitted changes) | Keep, Switch to fix, Delete anyway |
| Safe + No merge needed | Delete, Keep |
| Has conflicts | Keep, Switch to resolve, Delete anyway |

## Session Tracking

After cleanup, displays:
- Sessions deleted
- Sessions merged
- Sessions kept
- Orphaned registry entries cleaned
