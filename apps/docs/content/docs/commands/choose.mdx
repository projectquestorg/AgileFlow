# /choose

Use AI to analyze trade-offs and recommend the best option when multiple valid approaches exist.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:choose best approach to fix slow API response times
```

This analyzes options and explains trade-offs to guide your decision.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<decision>` | Yes | The decision to analyze |
| `CONTEXT` | No | Additional context for the decision |

## Usage Examples

### Performance decision

```bash
/agileflow:choose best approach to fix slow API response times
```

Analyzes options like caching, query optimization, pagination.

### Architecture decision

```bash
/agileflow:choose authentication approach for new API CONTEXT="multi-tenant SaaS, 50K users"
```

Considers JWT, sessions, OAuth with your context.

### Development approach

```bash
/agileflow:choose how to implement the new dashboard feature
```

Weighs quick prototype vs. full architecture vs. incremental TDD.

## How It Works

The command performs 4-step decision analysis:

### Step 1: Analyze the Decision

Understands what's being decided:
- What are the constraints?
- What matters most? (speed, quality, maintainability)
- What's the current context?

### Step 2: Generate Options

For each viable approach:
- **Name**: Clear label for the option
- **Description**: What it entails
- **Pros**: Benefits and strengths
- **Cons**: Drawbacks and risks
- **Effort**: Implementation cost
- **Risk**: Potential failure modes

### Step 3: Evaluate Against Criteria

Scores each option against:
- **Fit**: How well it matches requirements
- **Feasibility**: How practical to implement
- **Future-proof**: How well it handles change
- **Team capacity**: Skills and time available

### Step 4: Make Recommendation

Selects the best option and explains:
- Why this option wins
- What trade-offs are accepted
- What risks to monitor
- What next steps to take

## Examples

### Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Best approach to fix slow API response times

**Options Considered**:
1. Add Caching (Redis)
2. Optimize Database Queries
3. Add Pagination

**Recommendation**: Start with database optimization, then add caching

**Rationale**: Optimizing queries addresses the root cause. Adding caching on top of slow queries just hides the problem. Start with the foundation, then layer caching for frequently accessed data.

### Architecture Decision

**Decision**: Authentication approach for multi-tenant SaaS (50K users)

**Options Considered**:
1. JWT with short expiry
2. Session-based auth
3. OAuth 2.0 with Identity Provider

**Recommendation**: OAuth 2.0 with Identity Provider

**Rationale**: Enterprises will expect SSO. Managing auth in-house is a liability. Auth0/Okta handle the complexity. Worth the integration effort upfront.

### Development Approach

**Decision**: Development approach for new dashboard

**Options Considered**:
1. Quick prototype (fast, risky)
2. Full architecture first (solid, slow)
3. Incremental TDD (balanced)

**Recommendation**: Incremental TDD

**Rationale**: Dashboard is user-facing with many edge cases. TDD ensures components work correctly from the start, and refactoring is safe when design evolves.

## Output Format

Every decision outputs this format:

```markdown
## Decision: [question]

### Context
[Summary of situation and constraints]

### Options Analyzed

#### Option 1: [name]
**Description**: [what it is]
**Pros**: [benefits]
**Cons**: [drawbacks]
**Effort**: [low/medium/high]
**Risk**: [potential issues]

#### Option 2: [name]
...

### Analysis

[Comparison matrix or discussion]

### Recommendation

**Selected: [option name]**

**Rationale**: [why this option is best for this situation]

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- [trade-off 1]
- [trade-off 2]

### Next Steps
1. [immediate action]
2. [follow-up action]
3. [verification step]
```

## Expert Delegation

For complex decisions, delegate analysis to domain experts:

```bash
/agileflow:choose best database for this workload
# With expert delegation to database and performance specialists
```

The command can spawn experts in parallel to analyze from different angles before synthesis.

## When NOT to Use

- **Simple yes/no questions** - Just answer directly
- **Only one viable option** - Just proceed
- **User has already decided** - Just implement
- **Trivial decisions** - Don't over-engineer the process

Use `/agileflow:choose` for decisions that:
- Have 2+ viable options
- Involve trade-offs worth analyzing
- Benefit from structured thinking
- Need documented rationale

## Best Practices

1. **Include context** - More context = better recommendations
2. **Define success criteria** - What matters most?
3. **Be honest about trade-offs** - Every option has downsides
4. **Document decisions** - Use `/agileflow:adr` for important architectural choices
5. **Revisit decisions** - Circumstances change; choices may need updating

## Integration with Other Commands

After making a decision:

- **Document it**: Use `/agileflow:adr` to create Architecture Decision Record
- **Create work**: Use `/agileflow:story` to create stories for implementation
- **Implement it**: Use `/agileflow:babysit` to implement the selected approach
