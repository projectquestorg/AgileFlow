# /team:guide

Comprehensive guide covering Agent Teams architecture, migration from subagent mode, quality gates configuration, troubleshooting, and best practices.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:team:guide
```

## What This Covers

### Architecture

- **Native Agent Teams mode**: Team lead in delegate mode, independent teammate sessions with file-locking, shared task lists, inter-agent messaging
- **Subagent orchestrator mode**: Fallback using AgileFlow's built-in orchestrator with Task/TaskOutput coordination
- **Dual-mode architecture**: Both modes produce the same results through different execution mechanisms

### Quality Gates

- **TeammateIdle gate**: Runs when a teammate finishes work (tests, lint, types)
- **TaskCompleted gate**: Runs when a builder marks a task complete (validator approval)
- Configuration via `/agileflow:configure` or template JSON

### Task Synchronization

- Bidirectional sync between Claude Code's native task list (`~/.claude/tasks/`) and AgileFlow's `status.json`
- Messaging bridge translates between AgileFlow bus and Claude Code inter-agent messaging

### Migration Guide

Step-by-step instructions for migrating from subagent orchestrator mode to native Agent Teams:

1. Enable `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`
2. Verify templates work with `/team:list`
3. Start a team with `/team:start`
4. Monitor with `/team:status`

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for:
- Team startup failures
- Quality gate configuration
- Task synchronization problems
- Messaging bridge issues
- Teammate crashes and recovery

### Custom Templates

How to create custom team templates in `.agileflow/teams/<name>.json` with:
- Lead configuration (delegate mode, plan approval)
- Teammate definitions (agent, role, domain)
- Quality gate rules
