---

# /seo:geo

Analyze and optimize content for AI search platforms (Generative Engine Optimization). Ensure your content gets cited by ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, and Claude.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:seo:geo https://example.com                      # Full GEO analysis
/agileflow:seo:geo https://example.com/blog/guide            # Analyze specific content page
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<URL>` | Yes | Page or site to analyze |

## Background: What is GEO?

**GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** optimizes content for AI-powered search:
- Google AI Overviews
- ChatGPT (with Browse/Search)
- Perplexity
- Claude
- Microsoft Copilot
- Other generative AI platforms

**Key insight**: Brand correlation is 3x stronger than backlinks for AI visibility. 92% of AI citations come from pages ranking in top 10 traditional search results.

## 5 GEO Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Citability** | 25% | Self-contained, quotable answer blocks |
| **Structure** | 20% | Organized content easy for AI to parse |
| **Multimodal** | 15% | Mix of text, images, video, tables |
| **Authority** | 20% | Credibility signals (author, sources, dates) |
| **Technical Access** | 20% | AI bots can access and parse content |

## 1. Citability (25%)

AI platforms cite content with self-contained, quotable blocks:

```markdown
BAD (too long, not self-contained):
Web performance is important for user experience.
There are many metrics to measure web performance
including page load time, time to interactive, and
various other metrics that browsers track. Among
these metrics, Core Web Vitals are important for
Google rankings because they measure how users
actually experience pages in the real world with
real devices on real networks, and they encompass
key aspects of what we think of as a good web
experience today. There are three Core Web Vitals:
LCP, which measures the time it takes for the
largest piece of content to show up on the page,
INP which measures how responsive a page is to
user interactions like clicks and keyboard presses,
and CLS which measures how stable the page is visually.

GOOD (134-167 words, self-contained, quotable):
Core Web Vitals are Google's three ranking factors
that measure page speed and usability. LCP (Largest
Contentful Paint) measures how fast the main content
appears, typically targeting under 2.5 seconds. INP
(Interaction to Next Paint) measures responsiveness
to user interactions, targeting under 200
milliseconds. CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) measures
visual stability, targeting a score below 0.1. These
metrics directly impact user experience and SEO
rankings, making optimization essential for modern
web performance.
```

**Check for**:
- Paragraphs in 134-167 word range
- Self-contained facts that work standalone
- Specific data points, dates, numbers
- Clear definitions ("X is Y")
- Proper attribution ("According to...")

## 2. Structure (20%)

AI platforms parse structured content more effectively:

```markdown
GOOD STRUCTURE:
# Main Topic

## What is X?
[Self-contained paragraph explaining X]

## How does X work?
1. Step 1 description
2. Step 2 description
3. Step 3 description

## Key Benefits
- Benefit 1: Specific advantage with numbers
- Benefit 2: Specific advantage
- Benefit 3: Specific advantage

| Feature | Your Product | Alternative |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Price | $99/month | $149/month |
| Support | 24/7 | Business hours |

## Summary
[TL;DR of main points]

BAD STRUCTURE:
Long paragraphs without clear headers
- No question-based headings
- All information buried in prose
- No step-by-step guides
- No tables or comparisons
```

**Check for**:
- H2/H3 headers as questions (Who, What, How, Why)
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Numbered or bulleted lists
- Tables for comparisons
- TL;DR or summary sections

## 3. Multimodal Content (15%)

Pages with multiple content types get 156% higher AI citation rates:

| Content Type | Impact | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Text** | Base | Written explanation |
| **+ Images** | +40% citations | Diagrams, screenshots, photos |
| **+ Video** | +156% citations | Embedded tutorials, demos |
| **+ Tables** | +60% citations | Data comparisons |
| **+ Interactive** | +89% citations | Calculators, tools, assessments |

**Check for**:
- Informative images with good alt text
- Embedded videos with transcripts
- Data in table format
- Interactive elements (calculators, quizzes)
- Infographics or diagrams

## 4. Authority (20%)

AI platforms prioritize authoritative sources:

| Signal | Good | Poor |
|--------|------|------|
| **Author credentials** | Named author with bio/expertise | No attribution |
| **Publication date** | Recent, prominently displayed | No dates or very old |
| **Primary sources** | Original data, research, case studies | Only secondary sources |
| **Citations** | Links to authoritative references | No outbound links |
| **Brand presence** | Mentioned on Wikipedia, trusted sites | No cross-platform presence |

**Check for**:
- Author name and credentials
- Publication date clearly visible
- References to authoritative sources
- Bylines with expertise description
- Brand mentions in trusted publications

## 5. Technical Access (20%)

AI bots must be able to access your content:

| Check | Good | Poor |
|-------|------|------|
| **GPTBot allowed** | Not blocked | Blocked in robots.txt |
| **ClaudeBot allowed** | Not blocked | Blocked |
| **PerplexityBot allowed** | Not blocked | Blocked |
| **Google-Extended** | Not blocked | Blocked |
| **/llms.txt present** | Exists at root | Missing |
| **Server-side rendering** | Content in HTML | JS-only rendering |
| **Fast response** | Quick TTFB < 800ms | Slow or rate-limited |

**robots.txt Example** (allows AI bots):
```
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow:

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Disallow:

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Disallow:

User-agent: Google-Extended
Disallow:
