# /ads:budget

Run a budget allocation and bidding strategy audit using 24 checks to analyze spend efficiency, identify wasted budget, validate bidding strategies, and provide specific reallocation recommendations.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ads:budget <account-data>                  # Full budget audit
```

## What It Checks

The audit applies 24 deterministic checks across 4 categories:

| Category | Weight | Checks | Focus |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Budget Allocation | 35% | 8 | Spend distribution, top-performer focus, funnel stages |
| Bidding Strategy | 30% | 8 | Strategy alignment, conversion data, target metrics |
| Scaling & Pacing | 20% | 4 | Budget growth rates, pacing consistency, learning phase |
| Platform Mix | 15% | 4 | Diversification, attribution, platform strength alignment |

## Output

You receive:
- **Budget Score** (0-100)
- **Category breakdown** with individual scores
- **Specific findings** with severity levels
- **Dollar reallocation recommendations** - Not just "move budget" but "move $X from Campaign A to Campaign B"
- **Industry benchmarks** for your business type
- **Platform minimum validation** across 6 platforms
- **Scaling rule compliance** check

## Account Data Needed

Provide:
- Monthly spend by platform
- Campaign-level budgets
- Performance metrics (CPA, ROAS, conversions)
- Bid strategies in use
- Industry and target metrics

Example format:
```
Google Ads: $6K/month
- Brand campaign: $2K, CPA $30
- Non-brand: $3K, CPA $45
- Performance Max: $1K, ROAS 1.8:1

Meta Ads: $4K/month
- Prospecting: $2.5K, CPA $40
- Retargeting: $1.5K, ROAS 2.5:1
```

## Platform Budget Minimums

These minimums MUST be enforced:

| Platform | Campaign Minimum | Ad Set/Group Minimum |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Google Ads | $10/day | $5/day |
| Meta Ads | $20/day | $10/day |
| LinkedIn | $50/day | $25/day |
| TikTok | $50/day campaign | $20/day ad group |
| Microsoft | $10/day | $5/day |

## Scaling Rules

1. **Max 20% budget increase per week** - Gradual scaling prevents budget waste
2. **Only scale after learning phase exits** - Campaigns need 2-4 weeks of optimization
3. **3x Kill Rule** - Pause campaigns with CPA > 3x target immediately
4. **Minimum 2 weeks data** before making major changes

## Industry Benchmarks

### SaaS
| Metric | Good | Average | Poor |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| CPA (Lead) | \<$50 | $50-150 | >$150 |
| ROAS | >5:1 | 3:1-5:1 | \<3:1 |

### E-commerce
| Metric | Good | Average | Poor |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| ROAS | >4:1 | 2:1-4:1 | \<2:1 |
| CPA (Purchase) | \<$30 | $30-80 | >$80 |

### Local Services
| Metric | Good | Average | Poor |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| CPL | \<$25 | $25-75 | >$75 |
| CPC | \<$3 | $3-8 | >$8 |

## Example Usage

### Basic Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:budget "Spending $10K/month. Google $6K (CPA $40), Meta $4K (ROAS 2:1). Google is doing better, allocate more there."
# Returns: Budget Score with specific reallocation recommendations
```

### With Detailed Data
```bash
/agileflow:ads:budget
# Paste detailed monthly breakdown with all campaign performance data
# Returns: Full budget audit with dollar-specific recommendations
```

## Expected Improvements

By following the reallocation recommendations:
- **5-15% improvement** in overall ROAS/CPA within 2-4 weeks
- **Elimination of budget waste** on underperforming campaigns
- **Faster scaling** of top performers while respecting platform limits
- **Better platform mix** based on actual performance, not assumptions

## When to Run

- **Monthly** - Monitor budget health and allocation efficiency
- **After campaign launches** - First 3-4 weeks after new campaigns
- **When metrics change** - If CPA or ROAS shifts significantly
- **Quarterly review** - Comprehensive budget strategy review
- **Before budget increases** - Ensure current allocation is optimal before adding spend

## Tips

- **Bring real numbers** - Use actual CPA/ROAS data for accurate recommendations
- **Include all platforms** - Full picture gives better recommendations
- **Track conversions** - Budget audit needs conversion data to be accurate
- **Follow 70/20/10 rule** - 70% proven campaigns, 20% testing, 10% experimental
