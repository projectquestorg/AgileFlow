---

# /ads:tiktok

Run an inline audit on a TikTok Ads account with 8 focused checks. TikTok requires creative-first strategy and strict learning phase management.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ads:tiktok <account-data>                  # TikTok Ads audit
```

## The 8 Checks

| # | Check | Severity | Pass Criteria |
|---|-------|----------|---------------|
| TT-1 | TikTok Pixel installed | CRITICAL | Pixel on all pages, Events API preferred |
| TT-2 | Learning phase management | CRITICAL | 50 conversions in 7 days per ad group |
| TT-3 | Budget meets minimum | CRITICAL | $50/day campaign, $20/day ad group |
| TT-4 | Creative safe zones | HIGH | Key content within center 720x900px |
| TT-5 | Video-first creatives | HIGH | All ads are video (no static images) |
| TT-6 | UGC/authentic style | HIGH | Native-feeling content (not polished ads) |
| TT-7 | Sound-on design | MEDIUM | Audio is integral, not optional |
| TT-8 | Creative refresh cadence | HIGH | New creatives every 1-2 weeks |

## Output

You receive:
- **TikTok Score** (0-100)
- **Check results** - Pass/fail for all 8 checks
- **Key recommendations** - Top priorities
- **TikTok-specific tips** - Platform best practices
- **Creative guidance** - How to create TikTok-native ads

## Account Data Needed

Provide details about your TikTok Ads:
- Pixel installation status
- Campaign budget and daily spend
- Learning phase status (conversions/week)
- Creative types and refresh frequency
- Video specs (duration, style)
- Audio strategy
- Campaign objectives

Example format:
```
TikTok Ads Setup
- Pixel installed, no Events API
- 2 campaigns, $30/day each
- 5 video ads, 2 weeks old
- Learning phase: 15 conversions/week (need 50)
- Videos are polished product demos
```

## TikTok-Specific Context

**Learning Phase is Critical**:
- TikTok needs 50 conversions in 7 days per ad group to exit learning
- At $20/day minimum: $140/week = 50 conversions needed
- That requires CPA < $2.80 - often unrealistic for cold audience
- **Solution**: Optimize for upper-funnel events (View Content, Add to Cart) until volume builds

## Creative Best Practices

### Hook (First 3 Seconds)
- **Pattern interrupt** - Grab attention immediately
- Don't spend time on branding/intro
- Hook = success (3-second swipe threshold)

### Duration
- **15-30 seconds** - Sweet spot for most objectives
- **Avoid 60+ seconds** - Drop-off increases
- Test 15s and 30s versions

### Format
- **Vertical 9:16 only** - No landscape videos
- **High contrast** - Ensure visibility on small screens
- **Keep safe zone clear** - Key content in center

### Audio Strategy
- **Sound-ON by default** - Design assuming sound is on
- **Captions/text overlay** - For sound-off viewing (subways, etc.)
- **Trending audio** - TikTok algorithm favors trending sounds
- **Original audio** - Sometimes outperforms trending sounds

### Creative Style
- **Authentic > polished** - Trend-aware content outperforms ads
- **Native TikTok style** - Looks like user content, not corporate
- **Influencer/UGC** - Often outperforms brand content
- **Behind-the-scenes** - Humanizes brand

## Example Usage

### Basic Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:tiktok "TikTok: Pixel installed, $30/day, 3 video ads, polished style, only 10 conversions/week. No audio strategy."
# Returns: TikTok Score with key improvements
```

### Detailed Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:tiktok
# Paste detailed campaign and creative data
# Returns: Full 8-check audit with TikTok-specific recommendations
```

## Expected Improvements

By implementing recommendations:
- **10-20% improvement** in CTR through better hooks
- **Exit learning phase** faster with proper creative
- **Creative fatigue** reduced through regular refresh
- **Audience reach** expanded as TikTok algorithm learns
- **3-5x improvement** possible with authentic UGC content

## Learning Phase Strategy

**Problem**: Need 50 conversions/week to exit learning

**Solutions**:
1. **Optimize for upper-funnel** - Track "View Content" or "Add to Cart" instead of "Purchase"
2. **Combine multiple ad groups** - Aggregate conversions across groups
3. **Start with engaged audiences** - Website visitors, email list (warmer than cold)
4. **Increase budget temporarily** - Get past learning faster (then optimize)
5. **Extend timeline** - Plan for 3-4 weeks in learning phase

## Platform-Specific Advantages

**Why TikTok?**
- 1.5B monthly active users
- Younger demographic (Gen Z, millennials)
- Highest engagement rates of any platform
- Algorithm discovers new content (not just follower-based)
- Lower CPCs than Meta or Google (for young audiences)

**Best For**:
- Consumer products (especially youth-focused)
- E-commerce (apparel, accessories, beauty)
- Entertainment content
- Viral/trendy products
- Apps targeting under-35 demographic

## Tips

- **"Don't make ads, make TikToks"** - Native content outperforms ads
- **Spark Ads** - Boosting organic content often outperforms traditional ads
- **Creative fatigue hits fast** - 7-14 days vs 30 on Meta
- **Use Creative Center** - TikTok's tool for trending sounds and formats
- **Test UGC** - User-generated or influencer content often wins
- **Audio matters** - Trending audio gets algorithmic boost

## When to Run

- **Monthly** - Monitor creative health and learning phase
- **After creative changes** - Ensure new content is TikTok-native
- **Performance decline** - Diagnose creative fatigue
- **Quarterly review** - Comprehensive strategy assessment
