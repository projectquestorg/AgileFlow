description: Microsoft Ads audit with 7 checks for search partner management, UET tag, LinkedIn targeting, and import quality from Google Ads
---

# /ads:microsoft

Run an inline audit on a Microsoft Ads (formerly Bing Ads) account with 7 focused checks. Microsoft Ads often runs as a Google import—verify it's optimized for the platform.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ads:microsoft <account-data>               # Microsoft Ads audit
```

## The 7 Checks

| # | Check | Severity | Pass Criteria |
|---|-------|----------|---------------|
| MS-1 | UET tag installed | CRITICAL | Universal Event Tracking tag on all pages |
| MS-2 | Search partner performance | HIGH | Syndication partners monitored, poor ones disabled |
| MS-3 | Import quality from Google | HIGH | No broken bid strategies or unsupported features |
| MS-4 | Bid adjustments set | MEDIUM | Microsoft-specific bids (not just Google copy) |
| MS-5 | LinkedIn targeting | HIGH | LinkedIn demographics used for B2B targeting |
| MS-6 | Audience Ads opt-in reviewed | MEDIUM | Microsoft Audience Network reviewed for performance |
| MS-7 | Conversion goals | HIGH | Microsoft-native conversion tracking active |

## Output

You receive:
- **Microsoft Score** (0-100)
- **Check results** - Pass/fail for all 7 checks
- **Key recommendations** - Top priorities to improve
- **Microsoft-specific tips** - Platform best practices
- **Import quality assessment** - If imported from Google

## Account Data Needed

Provide details about your Microsoft Ads:
- UET tag installation status
- Import source (native or imported from Google)
- Budget and spend
- Campaign structure
- Bid adjustments configured
- LinkedIn targeting usage
- Conversion goal setup
- Search partner performance

Example format:
```
Microsoft Ads Setup
- Imported from Google 6 months ago
- 5 campaigns, $200/month total
- No bid adjustments beyond Google import
- Mostly default settings, not Microsoft-optimized
- No LinkedIn targeting used
```

## Microsoft Ads Context

**Why Microsoft?**
- Lower CPCs than Google (5-10% less typical)
- Older, higher-income demographic
- Better for B2B (access to LinkedIn targeting)
- Less competitive keywords
- Smaller audience, but valuable

**Who Uses It:**
- B2B companies targeting decision-makers
- Local services in underserved markets
- E-commerce with higher-value customers
- Businesses wanting lower CPA than Google

## Import Quality Issues

If you imported from Google, common problems:

| Issue | Impact | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Unsupported bid strategies | Won't work on Microsoft | Switch to supported strategies |
| Negative keyword list conflicts | Blocking good traffic | Re-import negative lists carefully |
| Campaign structure mismatch | Suboptimal targeting | Restructure for Microsoft |
| Device bid adjustments | May not transfer | Reconfigure for Microsoft |
| Audience targeting mismatch | Won't reach intended audience | Reset targeting for platform |

## LinkedIn Targeting Advantage

Microsoft's unique advantage: **LinkedIn profile targeting**

This lets you target by:
- Company name
- Industry
- Job function
- Job title
- Seniority level

For B2B, this is extremely powerful. Example:
```
Target: Software developers at Fortune 500 companies
Google: Target keyword "Python developer", broad reach
Microsoft: Target LinkedIn "Software Developer" + "Fortune 500" = precise
```

## Example Usage

### Basic Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:microsoft "Microsoft: Imported from Google 3 months ago. No changes made since. Using same bid strategies and audiences as Google."
# Returns: Microsoft Score with import quality assessment
```

### Detailed Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:microsoft
# Paste detailed account setup and performance data
# Returns: Full 7-check audit with optimization recommendations
```

## Expected Improvements

By implementing recommendations:
- **Proper import optimization** - Fix broken strategies from Google import
- **5-10% CPA improvement** - Microsoft Ads typically cheaper than Google
- **Better audience targeting** - LinkedIn profile targeting for B2B
- **Search partner optimization** - 2-5% improvement by disabling poor partners

## Microsoft-Specific Strategies

### B2B Targeting
LinkedIn targeting + keyword matching = powerful combo
```
Campaign: Target "VP Sales" at "Tech Companies"
Keywords: "sales enablement software"
Audiences: LinkedIn profile targeting
Result: Highly relevant, high-quality leads
```

### Search Partner Optimization
- Microsoft Audience Network: Yahoo, AOL, DuckDuckGo
- Performance varies by partner
- Monitor individually, disable underperformers
- Start with all partners, disable low-ROI ones

### Bid Adjustments
- Don't just copy from Google
- Microsoft's scale is different
- Often lower bids work here
- Monitor CPA carefully during transition

## Tips

- **Don't just "set and forget" imports** - Google imports need Microsoft optimization
- **LinkedIn targeting is differentiator** - Use it for B2B campaigns
- **Search partners matter** - Monthly review and optimization
- **Audience demographic older/higher income** - Adjust messaging if needed
- **Lower CPCs** - Don't use Google bids, test lower Microsoft bids

## When to Run

- **After Google import** - Verify import quality and optimize
- **Monthly** - Monitor search partner performance
- **Performance decline** - Diagnose optimization issues
- **Quarterly review** - Comprehensive strategy assessment
