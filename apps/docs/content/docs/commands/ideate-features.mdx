description: Multi-agent feature brainstorming audit - analyzes your app and suggests new features, UX improvements, integrations, and growth opportunities

# /ideate:features

Deploy multiple specialized brainstorm analyzers in parallel to find missing features, UX improvements, market-standard patterns, growth opportunities, and integration gaps. Then synthesize results through consensus into a prioritized Feature Brainstorm Report.

**Key difference from `/ideate:new`**: Ideation finds technical improvements to existing code (refactoring, security fixes, performance). Brainstorm audit finds **new product features** the app should have — what to build, not what to fix.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:features app/
```

Analyze app for missing features using the core 3 brainstorm analyzers (Features, UX, Market).

## Parameters

| Parameter | Values | Default | Description |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `TARGET` | file/directory | `.` | What to analyze |
| `DEPTH` | `quick`, `deep` | `quick` | quick = core 3 analyzers, deep = all 5 |
| `FOCUS` | `features,ux,market,growth,integration,all` | `all` | Which analyzers to deploy |

## Usage Examples

### Quick scan (default)

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:features app/
```

Analyze app quickly using core 3 analyzers (Features, UX, Market). Focus on HIGH_VALUE and MEDIUM_VALUE ideas only.

### Deep comprehensive analysis

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:features . DEPTH=deep
```

Deploy all 5 analyzers for comprehensive brainstorming (adds Growth and Integration analyzers).

### Focus on specific areas

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:features src/ FOCUS=features,ux
```

Deploy only specific analyzers (Features and UX in this case).

### All features with deep analysis

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:features . DEPTH=deep FOCUS=all
```

Comprehensive brainstorm audit with all analyzers and value levels.

## Brainstorm Analyzers

### Core 3 (Quick Mode)

- **Features Analyzer** - Missing CRUD, half-built features, incomplete workflows, missing data features
- **UX Analyzer** - Missing feedback states, accessibility, navigation gaps, responsive design issues
- **Market Analyzer** - Table-stakes features for the app's category, competitive gaps

### Additional 2 (Deep Mode Only)

- **Growth Analyzer** - Onboarding flows, notifications, sharing mechanics, retention hooks, user management
- **Integration Analyzer** - Auth providers, third-party services, data portability, API extensibility, webhooks

## Value Scale (Feature Priority)

| Value | Definition | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **HIGH_VALUE** | Users actively need this or will leave without it | Missing search on a list of 100+ items |
| **MEDIUM_VALUE** | Improves the experience significantly | Export to CSV for data portability |
| **NICE_TO_HAVE** | Polish that delights users | Dark mode, keyboard shortcuts |
| **SPECULATIVE** | Might be useful, needs validation | AI-powered suggestions |

## When to Use

Use feature brainstorming when:

- You want to find what features should be built next
- You've finished core functionality and want to improve
- You need to identify gaps relative to market standards
- You want structured feature discovery from multiple perspectives
- You're planning next quarter's roadmap

## Output Example

```
💡 Feature Brainstorm Audit: app/
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Deploying 3 brainstorm analyzers (quick mode)...
✓ Features Analyzer
✓ UX Analyzer
✓ Market Analyzer

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 BRAINSTORM SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

18 raw suggestions → 12 unique features

★ QUICK WINS (High Value, Low Effort)

1. Add loading spinner during processing [CONFIRMED by Features, UX]
   Value: HIGH | Effort: SMALL
   Users see frozen UI — think the app is broken

2. Add drag-and-drop upload [CONFIRMED by UX, Market]
   Value: HIGH | Effort: SMALL
   Users expect drag-and-drop in 2026 — file input feels dated

3. Show result confidence explanation [LIKELY - UX]
   Value: MEDIUM | Effort: SMALL
   Users don't understand what "73%" means in context

🎯 STRATEGIC FEATURES

4. Batch analysis [CONFIRMED by Features, Market]
   Value: HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM
   Analyze multiple items at once — market standard

5. Result history with comparison [LIKELY - Features]
   Value: HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM
   Users can't review past analyses or compare

```

## Confidence Levels

- **CONFIRMED** - 2+ analyzers agree → High priority
- **LIKELY** - 1 analyzer with strong evidence → Medium priority
- **SPECULATIVE** - 1 analyzer, weak evidence → Lower priority

## Results Location

Feature Brainstorm Report saved to:

```
docs/08-project/brainstorm-audits/brainstorm-audit-{YYYYMMDD}.md
```

Each report includes:
- App category detection
- Feature suggestions by analyzer
- Deduplication and confidence voting
- Prioritized Quick Wins and Strategic Features
- Implementation hints for each feature

## Integration with Other Commands

After brainstorm audit:

- **Create stories**: `npx agileflow story` to turn ideas into work
- **Create epic**: `npx agileflow epic` to group related features
- **Re-analyze**: Run again with `DEPTH=deep` for more detail
- **Document decision**: `npx agileflow adr` if rejecting features

## Best Practices

1. **Start with quick depth** - 3 analyzers are usually sufficient
2. **Review with team** - Share report with product team
3. **Prioritize quick wins** - Implement high-value, low-effort features first
4. **Use FOCUS to zoom in** - Analyze specific areas in depth
5. **Archive completed reports** - Keep for roadmap history

## Boundary Rules

This command does NOT cover:

- **Code quality issues** (use `/ideate:new` for refactoring)
- **Security vulnerabilities** (use `/code:security`)
- **Performance problems** (use `/code:performance`)
- **Test gaps** (use `/code:test`)
- **Bug fixes** (use `/code:completeness`)

## Related Commands

- [`/ideate:new`](/commands/ideate-new) - Technical improvement ideation
- [`/code:completeness`](/commands/code-completeness) - Find broken/incomplete features
- [`/story`](/commands/story) - Create user stories from brainstorm findings
- [`/epic`](/commands/epic) - Create epic for grouped features
- [`/adr`](/commands/adr) - Document feature decisions
