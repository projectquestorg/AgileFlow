## Creative Best Practices for YouTube

### The 5-Second Hook (Critical)
- **First 5 seconds determine skip rate** - Many viewers skip at 5s
- **Brand logo early** - Don't wait to reveal brand
- **Value prop immediately** - Why should they care?
- **Avoid slow intros** - Get to the point fast
- **Pattern interrupt** - Grab attention with visual or audio

### Video Duration
- **15-30 seconds optimal** - Best for action campaigns
- **Mobile-first** - 70%+ watching on mobile
- **Captions/subtitles essential** - Many watch without sound
- **Keep viewers engaged** - Reduce drop-off rate

### Format Variations to Test
- **Skippable in-stream (6s intro + 15s message)** - Most versatile
- **Bumper ads (6s)** - Remarketing, brand awareness
- **YouTube Shorts (up to 60s)** - Shorter, snackable content
- **In-feed ads (thumbnail + 30s video)** - Discovery-based

### Targeting Options on YouTube

**Custom Intent** (YouTube's secret weapon):
- Based on Google search behavior
- People searching for your keywords
- High intent audience
- Excellent for conversion

**Affinity**:
- Interest-based broad reach
- "People interested in running shoes"
- Good for awareness

**In-Market**:
- Active purchase intent
- "People researching car insurance"
- Great for conversions

**Remarketing**:
- Website visitors
- Video viewers
- YouTube engagement
- Highest conversion potential

**Customer Match**:
- Upload customer lists
- Target existing customers
- Used for upsell/retention

**Topic/Placement**:
- Specific YouTube channels/videos
- "Ads on fitness channels"
- Contextual targeting

## Example Usage

### Basic Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:youtube "YouTube: 2 campaigns (Video Reach, Video Action). 30-second skippable ads. Demographics targeting only. 25% skip rate. No frequency caps."
# Returns: YouTube Score with improvements
```

### Detailed Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:youtube
# Paste detailed campaign and creative data
# Returns: Full 8-check audit with YouTube-specific recommendations
```

## Expected Improvements

By implementing recommendations:
- **10-15% improvement** in CTR through better hooks
- **Lower CPV** through proper bid strategy
- **Better targeting** with Custom Intent audiences
- **Reduced frequency fatigue** through frequency capping
- **Higher conversion rate** with proper format selection

## YouTube-Specific Strategies

### Video Action Campaigns (Conversions)
- Skippable in-stream (most effective for conversions)
- 15-30 second duration optimal
- Strong CTA throughout video (not just end)
- Custom Intent audience essential
- Frequency cap at 3-5/week

### Video Reach Campaigns (Awareness)
- Bumper ads (6s) excellent for remarketing
- Cost-efficient for brand building
- Frequency cap important (avoid fatigue)
- Works well with email/retargeting combo

### YouTube Shorts (New Format)
- Vertical 9:16 format only
- Authentic, native style
- Younger demographic
- Good for brand awareness

## Bidding Strategy

| Objective | Best Bidding | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Conversions | tCPA (target CPA) | Automated optimization |
| Views | CPV (cost per view) | Simple, predictable |
| Awareness | CPM (cost per 1000) | Reach-focused |
| Clicks | CPC | Drive to landing page |

## Frequency Capping Recommendations

- **Brand awareness**: 1-2 per week
- **Consideration**: 2-3 per week
- **Conversion**: 3-5 per week (higher frequency OK since recent engagement)
- **Remarketing**: 5-7 per week (engaged audience tolerates more)

## Tips

- **Hook in 5 seconds** - Your most important creative element
- **Custom Intent is powerful** - Use search-based audiences
- **Test Shorts versions** - Create vertical versions of successful long-form
- **Bumper ads cheap** - Use for frequency capping after initial videos
- **Conversion tracking required** - Set up properly before scaling
- **Video Action campaigns drive ROI** - Best for conversions

## When to Run

- **Monthly** - Monitor creative performance
- **After new creative launch** - Verify creative is optimized

- **Before scaling** - Ensure setup correct before budget increase
