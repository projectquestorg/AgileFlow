description: Full multi-platform paid advertising audit with 6 parallel analyzers, industry detection, weighted Ads Health Score 0-100, and prioritized action plan
---

# /ads:audit

Deploy 6 specialized advertising analyzers in parallel to audit ad accounts across all platforms, then synthesize results through consensus into a weighted Ads Health Score (0-100) with prioritized action plan.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ads:audit <account-data>                       # Full audit (all platforms detected)
/agileflow:ads:audit <account-data> PLATFORMS=google,meta  # Specific platforms only
```

## How It Works

1. **Parse account data** - From pasted text, file, or description
2. **Detect industry** - Identifies SaaS, E-commerce, Local Services, B2B, Healthcare, etc.
3. **Deploy 6 analyzers in parallel** - Google, Meta, Budget, Creative, Tracking, Compliance
4. **Collect results** - Waits for all analyzer outputs
5. **Run consensus** - Weights and aggregates into Ads Health Score
6. **Generate report** - Creates Ads Audit Report with prioritized action plan

## The 6 Analyzers

| Analyzer | Checks | Focuses On |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Google Ads | 74 | Conversion tracking, wasted spend, account structure, keywords, ad copy, settings |
| Meta Ads | 46 | Pixel/CAPI, creative strategy, account structure, audience targeting |
| Budget & Bidding | 24 | Budget allocation, bidding strategy, scaling, platform mix |
| Creative Quality | 21 | Ad copy, visuals, platform requirements, performance testing |
| Conversion Tracking | 7 | Tags, events, deduplication, attribution, privacy, data quality |
| Compliance | 18 | Policy, regulatory, benchmarks, account health |

**Total: 190 checks applied in parallel**

## Category Weights

The analyzers' findings are weighted for your final score:

- **Conversion Tracking (25%)** - Foundation of all optimization
- **Wasted Spend (20%)** - Money being burned inefficiently
- **Account Structure (15%)** - Campaign organization and setup
- **Creative Quality (15%)** - Ad asset effectiveness
- **Budget & Bidding (15%)** - Spend allocation and strategy
- **Compliance (10%)** - Policy and regulatory adherence

## Output

You receive:
- **Ads Health Score** (0-100 with grade A-F)
- **Category breakdown** with individual scores
- **Critical issues** requiring immediate attention
- **High priority fixes** for this week
- **Medium priority optimizations** for backlog
- **Low priority items** to consider later
- **Platform summaries** (scores for each platform)
- **Budget reallocation recommendations**
- **Action plan** with quick wins and estimated impact

## Ads Health Score Grades

| Grade | Score | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| A | 90-100 | Excellent - well-optimized accounts |
| B | 80-89 | Good - minor optimization opportunities |
| C | 70-79 | Needs Work - significant improvements available |
| D | 60-69 | Poor - major issues affecting performance |
| F | <60 | Critical - fundamental problems, likely losing money |

## Account Data Format

Paste or describe your account data. Include:
- Campaign types and objectives
- Budget and monthly spend
- Conversion tracking setup
- Ad platform breakdown (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Ad performance metrics (CPA, ROAS, CTR, CVR)
- Targeting and audience setup
- Creative details (number of ads, formats used)

## Example Usage

### Full Audit (Recommended)
```bash
/agileflow:ads:audit
# Interactive: will ask for account data
# Returns: Ads Health Score with action plan
```

### With Account Data
```bash
/agileflow:ads:audit "Google Ads: $10K/month, 8 campaigns, avg CPC $3, CPA $50. Meta: $5K/month, 6 campaigns, ROAS 2.5:1. Using Broad Match, some tracking issues."
# Returns: Immediate analysis and scoring
```

### Specific Platforms Only
```bash
/agileflow:ads:audit <data> PLATFORMS=google,meta
# Only analyzes Google and Meta, skips LinkedIn/TikTok/etc.
```

## Quality Gates (Critical Rules)

These rules override the scoring and must be addressed first:

1. **Conversion tracking required** - No optimization recommendations without verified tracking
2. **No Broad Match without Smart Bidding** - Critical waste generator
3. **3x Kill Rule** - Campaigns with CPA > 3x target must be paused immediately
4. **Compliance first** - Legal violations trump optimization opportunities
5. **Learning phase protected** - Never change during learning windows

## When to Run

- **Monthly** - Monitor account health and prioritize optimization
- **After major changes** - New campaigns, platform setup, budget changes
- **Quarterly** - Comprehensive review of overall strategy
- **Before scaling** - Ensure account is optimized before increasing budget

## Next Steps After Audit

The audit report suggests next actions:

1. **Fix Critical Issues** - Address any tracking problems, compliance violations, or legal risks
2. **Implement Quick Wins** - Fast, high-impact improvements (usually 1-2 hours each)
3. **This Week Items** - Medium-effort, significant-impact fixes
4. **This Month Items** - Larger optimization projects
5. **Ongoing Items** - Monitoring and testing cadence
