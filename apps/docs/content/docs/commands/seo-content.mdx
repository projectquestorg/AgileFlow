> "Core Web Vitals are Google's three ranking factors that measure page speed: LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) measures how fast the main content appears, typically targeting under 2.5 seconds. INP (Interaction to Next Paint) measures responsiveness to user interactions, targeting under 200 milliseconds. CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) measures visual stability, targeting a score below 0.1. Optimizing these metrics improves both user experience and SEO rankings."
