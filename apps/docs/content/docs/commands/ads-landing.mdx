3. **Headline clarity** - Make value prop more prominent
4. **Trust signals** - Add/remove social proof elements
5. **Mobile layout** - Optimize specifically for mobile

## Performance Impact by Fix

| Optimization | Typical Lift | Effort |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Load time improvement | +5-15% | Medium |
| CTA above fold | +10-20% | Low |
| Form field reduction | +15-30% | Low |
| Trust signals added | +5-10% | Low |
| Message match fix | +10-25% | Low |

## When to Run

- **Before launching ad campaign** - Ensure landing page is optimized before spending
- **After A/B testing** - Audit winning variation
- **Performance decline** - If conversions drop, landing page may be issue
- **Monthly** - Keep pages optimized as standards evolve
- **Before scaling budget** - Don't scale until landing page optimized

## Tips

- **Mobile first** - 70%+ of traffic is mobile, optimize for phones
- **Speed matters** - Every 1 second of load time = 7% conversion drop
- **Message match is critical** - If ad says "free trial" but page says "demo", you lose conversions
- **Trust signals work** - Testimonials and badges increase conversion 5-10%
- **Test, don't guess** - Use actual data to decide what matters
