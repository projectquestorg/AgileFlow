# /ads:meta

Run a comprehensive Meta/Facebook Ads account audit using 46 deterministic checks across 4 categories to identify optimization opportunities and compliance issues.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ads:meta <account-data>                    # Full Meta Ads audit
```

## What It Checks

The audit applies 46 checks across 4 weighted categories:

| Category | Weight | Checks | Focus |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Pixel & CAPI Tracking | 30% | 12 | Pixel, CAPI, EMQ, AEM, dedup, privacy |
| Creative Strategy | 25% | 14 | Diversity, video, formats, refresh, DCO, fatigue |
| Account Structure | 25% | 10 | CBO, objectives, consolidation, learning phase |
| Audience Targeting | 20% | 10 | LAL, custom, overlap, retargeting, exclusions |

## Output

You receive:
- **Meta Ads Score** (0-100)
- **Category breakdown** with individual scores
- **Detailed findings** organized by severity
- **Evidence** - Actual account data triggering findings
- **Business impact** - Wasted spend or missed conversions
- **Remediation steps** - Exactly how to fix each issue
- **Quality gate status** - Pixel, domain verification, learning phase

## Account Data Needed

Provide details about your Meta Ads setup:
- Pixel and Conversions API (CAPI) setup status
- Campaign objectives and structure
- Number of campaigns, ad sets, ads
- Audience targeting (LAL, custom, interest)
- Creative assets (image, video, carousel)
- Budget and monthly spend
- Performance metrics (CPA, ROAS, conversions)
- Learning phase status

Example format:
```
Meta Ads Account Summary
- 4 campaigns, 12 ad sets, 30+ creatives
- Monthly spend: $5,000
- Pixel installed but no CAPI
- Using mostly LAL and website retargeting
- Few creative variations tested
- Some ads showing fatigue (frequency > 3.0)
```

## The 46 Checks Explained

### Pixel & CAPI Tracking (12 checks - 30% weight)
- Meta Pixel installed on all pages
- Conversions API (CAPI) configured
- Event Match Quality (EMQ) >= 6.0
- Standard events configured (Purchase, Lead, AddToCart)
- Custom conversions defined
- Aggregated Event Measurement configured
- Event deduplication working (with event_id)
- Business domain verified
- Purchase values passed for optimization
- Advanced matching enabled
- Pixel health validated
- Attribution settings (7-day click / 1-day view)

### Creative Strategy (14 checks - 25% weight)
- 3+ distinct creative concepts per ad set
- At least 1 video ad per campaign
- Aspect ratio coverage (1:1, 4:5, 9:16)
- 3+ copy variations per concept
- Multiple headlines tested
- UGC-style content tested
- New creatives within last 30 days
- No ads with frequency > 3.0 in cold audiences
- Text overlay < 20% of image
- Appropriate CTA button selected
- Landing page matches creative message
- Dynamic Creative Optimization tested
- Advantage+ creative features enabled
- Winners/losers identified with thresholds

### Account Structure (10 checks - 25% weight)
- Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) used
- Campaign objective aligned with goal
- Ad set consolidation (< 5 per campaign)
- Advantage+ Shopping tested (e-commerce)
- Learning phase healthy (50 conversions/week)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Budget follows 70/20/10 rule
- No micro-campaigns (< $20/day)
- Special Ad Categories declared (if applicable)
- Spending limits set as safety net

### Audience Targeting (10 checks - 20% weight)
- Lookalike audiences from quality data
- Custom audience freshness (updated 30 days)
- Audience overlap < 20% between ad sets
- Retargeting funnel (30/60/90+ day segments)
- Purchasers excluded from acquisition
- Audience size appropriate (1M-10M for prospecting)
- Advantage+ with broad targeting tested
- Interest stacking vs separation optimized
- Geographic targeting precise (for local)
- Age/gender performance analyzed

## Quality Gates (Critical Rules)

These override scoring and must be fixed first:

1. **Pixel required** - No optimization without Pixel installed
2. **Domain verification** - Needed for Aggregated Event Measurement
3. **Learning phase protection** - Never scale during 50 conversions/week ramp
4. **Special Ad Categories** - Legal requirement for housing, employment, credit

## Learning Phase Requirements

To exit learning phase:
- **50 conversions per week** required
- **7-14 days typical duration**
- **No major changes** during learning (bid changes, audience edits, creative swaps)
- **Consistent budget** during learning phase

## Example Usage

### Basic Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:meta "Meta Ads: 4 campaigns, Pixel installed no CAPI, LAL audiences, few creative variations, frequency high (3.5+), no CBO yet."
# Returns: Meta Ads Score with key issues
```

### Detailed Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:meta
# Paste detailed campaign structure, audience, and performance data
# Returns: Comprehensive 46-check audit with remediation steps
```

## Expected Improvements

By implementing the recommendations:
- **10-15% reduction** in cost per conversion through waste elimination
- **20-30% improvement** in conversion rate from creative refresh
- **Better learning phase** with proper budget and audience setup
- **Reduced ad fatigue** through strategic creative rotation
- **20-40% improvement** in attribution accuracy with CAPI

## Meta-Specific Tips

### Pixel vs CAPI
- Pixel: Browser-based, loses 20-40% of conversions on iOS 14.5+
- CAPI: Server-side, captures conversions Pixel misses
- Deploy BOTH for best coverage

### Creative Strategy
- Video ads: 2-3x better than static images
- 1:1 (square) most common, but always test 4:5 and 9:16
- UGC-style often beats polished ads
- Test new creative every 2-3 weeks (before fatigue)

### Audiences
- LAL (Lookalike) from purchase data outperforms interest audiences
- Broad targeting with Advantage+ tests well
- Always exclude converters from acquisition campaigns
- Retargeting funnel: 7/14/30/60/90+ days

### Learning Phase
- Needs 50 conversions/week to exit
- Don't scale during learning (patience required)
- CBO auto-optimizes, more stable than ABO
- Need minimum $20/day per ad set to reach 50 conversions/week

## When to Run

- **Monthly** - Monitor health and creative fatigue
- **After major changes** - New audiences, budget adjustments, structure changes
- **Quarterly review** - Comprehensive account assessment
- **Before scaling** - Ensure account is optimized before increasing budget
- **Performance decline** - Diagnose why metrics degrading

## Tips

- **Pixel first, everything else second** - Accurate tracking is foundation
- **CAPI essential** - Add server-side tracking for iOS reliability
- **Creative is king** - Spend 40% of energy on testing creatives
- **Learning phase sacred** - Don't change during ramp-up
- **Frequency cap it** - Avoid frequency > 3.0 in cold audiences
