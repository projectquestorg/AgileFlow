# /team:stop

Gracefully shut down the currently active team, syncing all final states back to AgileFlow's `status.json`.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:team:stop
```

## How It Works

1. Verifies an active team exists
2. Asks for confirmation via AskUserQuestion
3. Syncs final task states to `status.json`
4. Stops all teammate sessions (native mode) or subagent tasks (fallback mode)
5. Clears team state from `session-state.json`
6. Displays a final summary report with tasks completed

## Summary Report

After shutdown, shows:
- Total tasks completed
- Quality gate pass/fail counts
- Any incomplete tasks that need manual attention
- Time elapsed
