# /roadmap:analyze

Run automated competitor analysis using web research to identify feature gaps, compare capabilities, and generate actionable roadmap items.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:roadmap:analyze COMPETITORS="Jira,Linear,Shortcut"
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `COMPETITORS=<text>` | Comma-separated list of competitors to analyze (max 5) |
| `FOCUS=all\|features\|security\|perf\|ux` | Analysis focus area (default: all) |
| `OUTPUT=matrix\|report\|stories` | Output format (default: report) |

## How It Works

1. Researches each competitor via web search
2. Compares findings against current project capabilities from your codebase
3. Categorizes features:
   - **Must-have** - Found in 2+ competitors
   - **Nice-to-have** - Found in 1 competitor
4. Assigns confidence levels: HIGH (verified), MEDIUM (inferred), LOW (uncertain)
5. Shows preview before saving
6. Outputs to `docs/08-project/roadmap-{date}.md`

## Output Formats

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `matrix` | Feature comparison matrix across competitors |
| `report` | Detailed analysis report with recommendations |
| `stories` | Auto-generate user stories for identified gaps |
