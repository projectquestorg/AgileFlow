# /ideate:discover

Run a complete structured discovery workflow that orchestrates brainstorming, optional research, and Product Brief synthesis into a single end-to-end process.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="Mobile time tracking app"
```

With depth control:

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="Dashboard" DEPTH=quick
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="Analytics" DEPTH=deep
```

## Purpose

Bridge the gap between "vague idea" and "epic planning". This command validates product viability BEFORE decomposing into stories and epics.

```
Vague Idea → /ideate:discover → Product Brief → /epic → Stories → Implementation
```

Instead of jumping straight to coding, invest 5-45 minutes in structured discovery to:

- **Validate the idea** - Is it worth building?
- **Identify edge cases** - What could go wrong?
- **Surface competitive advantages** - How is this different?
- **Estimate scope** - What's the MVP?
- **Plan strategically** - What's the sequencing?

## Parameters

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| TOPIC | Yes | — | Product or feature name |
| DEPTH | No | `guided` | Discovery depth: `quick`, `guided`, or `deep` |

## Depth Modes

### Quick (5-10 minutes)

Best for: Well-understood features or iterations

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="Dark mode toggle" DEPTH=quick
```

**Flow**:
1. Brainstorm via `/ideate:new SCOPE=all` (auto-run, no interaction)
2. Skip research phase
3. Generate Product Brief immediately

**Output**: Product Brief with feature ideas and MoSCoW prioritization

### Guided (30-45 minutes) - **Recommended**

Best for: New features or significant changes

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="OAuth integration" DEPTH=guided
```

**Flow**:
1. Interactive brainstorm via `/ideate:new` (you select scope and depth)
2. Optional research phase (ask if you want to research)
3. Review ideation findings
4. Curate features before brief generation
5. Generate Product Brief

**Output**: Curated Product Brief with validated features

### Deep (2+ hours)

Best for: Major products or architectural decisions

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="Microservices migration" DEPTH=deep
```

**Flow**:
1. Comprehensive brainstorm via `/ideate:new SCOPE=all DEPTH=ultradeep`
2. Multi-stage research:
   - Market analysis
   - Competitive feature mapping
   - Technical feasibility
   - User research
3. Synthesize research findings
4. Detailed Product Brief with competitive positioning

**Output**: Comprehensive Product Brief with market context

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Brainstorm

Delegates to `/ideate:new` to deploy multiple domain experts:

- **Security expert** - Security features and compliance
- **Performance expert** - Scalability and optimization
- **Code quality expert** - Maintainability and refactoring
- **UX expert** - User experience and accessibility
- **Testing expert** - Test coverage and reliability
- **API expert** - API design and integration

Each expert generates 3-5 ideas, which are synthesized with confidence scoring.

**Output**: Ideation report with ranked ideas

### Phase 2: Research (optional in quick mode)

Delegates to `/research:ask` to investigate:

- **Market sizing** - Is there demand?
- **Competitive landscape** - What exists? What's different?
- **Technical feasibility** - Can we build it?
- **User needs** - What do users actually want?
- **Best practices** - How do others solve this?

**Output**: Research findings and analysis

### Phase 3: Synthesis

Delegates to `/ideate:brief` to:

1. Cross-reference ideation and research
2. Identify consensus features (2+ experts agree)
3. Spot contradictions requiring more research
4. Assign MoSCoW priorities
5. Generate Product Brief

**Output**: Professional Product Brief ready for epic planning

## Example Workflows

### Quick Discovery: Add Dark Mode

```bash
# Run quick discovery
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="Dark mode support" DEPTH=quick

# Review generated brief
cat docs/08-project/briefs/20250214-dark-mode-support-brief.md

# Create epic for MVP
/epic EP-0123 TITLE="Dark Mode Support"
```

Takes ~10 minutes. Ideal for well-scoped features.

### Guided Discovery: New Dashboard

```bash
# Run guided discovery (interactive)
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="Analytics Dashboard" DEPTH=guided

# You'll be asked:
# 1. What scope of analysis? (security, perf, code, ux, all)
# 2. How deep? (quick, deep, ultradeep)
# 3. Create stories or just report? (report, stories, both)

# System runs ideation, asks if you want research
# Shows findings and asks you to curate features
# Generates Product Brief

# Create epic with multiple stories
/epic EP-0124 TITLE="Analytics Dashboard MVP" \
  GOAL="Give users insights into their usage patterns"
```

Takes ~30-45 minutes. Includes research and curation.

### Deep Discovery: Microservices Migration

```bash
# Run deep discovery (comprehensive)
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="Microservices Replatforming" DEPTH=deep

# System runs comprehensive analysis:
# - Codebase analysis from 6 domains
# - Technical feasibility research
# - Competitive/market research
# - Risk analysis

# Review comprehensive brief
cat docs/08-project/briefs/20250214-microservices-replatforming-brief.md

# Schedule architectural review
# Create epic with architectural ADR reference
/epic EP-0125 \
  TITLE="Microservices Migration" \
  RESEARCH=docs/08-project/briefs/20250214-microservices-replatforming-brief.md
```

Takes 2-3 hours. Includes deep research and architectural context.

## Understanding the Output

The command produces a **Product Brief** saved to:

```
docs/08-project/briefs/{YYYYMMDD}-{topic-slug}-brief.md
```

The brief contains:

1. **Executive Summary** - What we're building and why
2. **User Personas** - Who we're building for
3. **Feature List with MoSCoW Prioritization**:
   - MUST HAVE - High confidence, build first
   - SHOULD HAVE - Medium confidence, build next
   - COULD HAVE - Nice-to-have, build if capacity
   - WON'T HAVE - Explicitly out of scope
4. **Success Metrics** - How we measure success
5. **Business Case** - ROI or strategic value
6. **Competitive Context** - Market positioning
7. **Risks & Mitigation** - Known challenges
8. **Next Steps** - Path to epic and implementation

Example brief excerpt:

```markdown
## Features with MoSCoW Prioritization

### MUST HAVE (2+ Experts Agree)
- Time tracking with start/stop
- Project categorization
- Export to invoice format
- Mobile responsive

### SHOULD HAVE (1 Expert, Validated by Research)
- Offline sync capability
- Automatic rate lookup
- Team collaboration

### COULD HAVE
- Receipt photo attachment
- Geolocation tagging

### WON'T HAVE (Out of Scope for v1)
- Full accounting integration
- Multi-currency support
```

## Workflow Integration

### From Brief to Epic

After brief generation:

```bash
# 1. Review the brief
cat docs/08-project/briefs/{date}-{topic}-brief.md

# 2. Create epic with brief as reference
/epic EP-0123 \
  TITLE="Mobile Time Tracking" \
  GOAL="Reduce timesheet creation from 30 min to 2 min" \
  RESEARCH=docs/08-project/briefs/{date}-{topic}-brief.md

# 3. Decompose into stories based on MoSCoW
/story US-0001 TITLE="Basic Timer" EPIC=EP-0123 \
  ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA="Timer starts and stops. Time is saved locally."

/story US-0002 TITLE="Project Selection" EPIC=EP-0123

# 4. Assign and implement
/assign STORY=US-0001 NEW_OWNER=claude
```

### Iterating on the Brief

Briefs aren't final—refine as you learn:

```bash
# Initial discovery
/ideate:discover TOPIC="Mobile app" DEPTH=quick

# Gather feedback
# Review brief and identify gaps

# Refine and regenerate
/ideate:brief TOPIC="Mobile app" RESEARCH=docs/10-research/user-feedback.md

# Or start fresh with more research
/ideate:discover TOPIC="Mobile app" DEPTH=deep
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Depth

| Choosing | Depth | Time |
|----------|-------|------|
| Small feature or iteration | quick | 5-10 min |
| New feature with some uncertainty | guided | 30-45 min |
| Major product or architecture | deep | 2-3 hours |

### 2. Save Time with Quick Mode

For routine iterations:

```bash
# MVP-ready in 5 minutes
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="Add export to CSV" DEPTH=quick
```

### 3. Use Guided Mode by Default

Most features need some validation:

```bash
# Recommended: Interactive, balanced
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="..." DEPTH=guided  # (default)
```

### 4. Invest in Deep Mode for Big Decisions

When considering major architectural changes:

```bash
# Comprehensive analysis for 2-3 hours
/agileflow:ideate:discover TOPIC="Rewrite auth system" DEPTH=deep
```
