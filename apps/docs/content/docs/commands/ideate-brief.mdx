# /ideate:brief

Synthesize brainstorming results and research findings into a professional Product Brief artifact.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:brief TOPIC="Mobile time tracking app"
```

With existing ideation file:

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:brief TOPIC="Mobile app" IDEATION=docs/08-project/ideation/ideation-20250214.md
```

With research findings:

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:brief TOPIC="Dashboard" RESEARCH=docs/10-research/research-dashboard.md,docs/10-research/ui-analysis.md
```

## Purpose

Generate a structured Product Brief that combines:

- **Ideation report findings** - Feature ideas, confidence levels, expert perspectives from `/ideate:new`
- **Research data** - Competitive analysis, market sizing, best practices, user research
- **Your knowledge synthesis** - Context-specific insights and constraints

This can be used standalone (with existing ideation/research files) or as Phase 3 of the `/ideate:discover` workflow.

## Parameters

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| TOPIC | Yes | Product or feature name (e.g., "Mobile time tracking app") |
| IDEATION | No | Path to ideation report file (if not provided, searches recent files) |
| RESEARCH | No | Comma-separated paths to research files |

## Output

Creates a structured Product Brief at: `docs/08-project/briefs/{YYYYMMDD}-{topic-slug}-brief.md`

The brief includes:

1. **Executive Summary** - Problem statement and value proposition
2. **User Personas** - Target users derived from research/brainstorming
3. **Features with MoSCoW Prioritization**:
   - **MUST HAVE** - High-confidence ideas (2+ experts agree)
   - **SHOULD HAVE** - Medium-confidence ideas
   - **COULD HAVE** - Single-expert ideas
   - **WON'T HAVE** - Explicitly ruled out
4. **Success Metrics** - How we measure product viability
5. **Business Case & ROI** - Simplified return on investment analysis
6. **Competitive Context** - Market positioning and differentiation
7. **Risks & Edge Cases** - Known challenges and mitigation strategies
8. **Next Steps** - Path to epic creation and implementation

## How It Works

### Confidence Mapping

The command uses confidence levels from ideation reports to prioritize features:

```
2+ Experts Agree  →  MUST HAVE (high confidence, build first)
1 Expert Agrees   →  SHOULD HAVE (medium confidence, build if capacity)
Contradictory     →  Research needed (investigate further)
```

### Input Detection

If `IDEATION` or `RESEARCH` parameters are omitted:

1. Searches `docs/08-project/ideation/` for the most recent ideation report
2. Searches `docs/10-research/` for matching research files
3. Prompts you to select from found files

### Synthesis Algorithm

1. Extracts feature ideas and confidence scores from ideation report
2. Cross-references with research findings (market validation, competitive features)
3. Groups related ideas into feature categories
4. Assigns MoSCoW priority based on confidence and strategic value
5. Estimates effort (High/Medium/Low) for each feature
6. Identifies gaps and contradictions requiring further research

## Workflow: From Idea to Epic

```
1. Brainstorm
   /ideate:discover TOPIC="..." DEPTH=quick

2. OR Use Existing Ideation
   /ideate:new SCOPE=all OUTPUT=report
   /ideate:brief TOPIC="..." IDEATION=docs/08-project/ideation/ideation-20250214.md

3. Add Research (Optional)
   /research:ask TOPIC="..."
   /research:import TOPIC="..."
   /ideate:brief TOPIC="..." RESEARCH=docs/10-research/...

4. Review Brief
   cat docs/08-project/briefs/20250214-{topic}-brief.md

5. Create Epic
   /epic EP-0001 TITLE="..." OWNER=... GOAL="..." RESEARCH=docs/08-project/briefs/...

6. Decompose into Stories
   /story US-0001 TITLE="..." ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA="..."
```

## Example Brief Output

A generated Product Brief looks like this:

```markdown
# Product Brief: Mobile Time Tracking App

**Date**: 2025-02-14
**Status**: Ready for Epic Planning
**Input**: Ideation Report + User Research

---

## Executive Summary

Mobile time tracking app for freelancers to track billable hours with automatic rate calculation.
Solves the problem of manual timesheet management and invoice generation delays.

**Value Proposition**: Reduce timesheet creation time from 30 minutes to 2 minutes per week.

---

## User Personas

### Persona 1: Independent Freelancer
- Manages 5-10 projects simultaneously
- Bills hourly or by milestone
- Pain point: Manual tracking loses time details
- Goal: Quick and accurate invoicing

### Persona 2: Agency PM
- Oversees 20+ contractor hours/week
- Needs team visibility
- Pain point: Contractor inconsistency in reporting
- Goal: Standardized tracking across team

---

## Features with MoSCoW Prioritization

### MUST HAVE (Build First)
- Timer with start/stop controls
- Project/task categorization (2+ experts agree on essentiality)
- Time entry export to invoice
- Mobile-responsive design

### SHOULD HAVE (Build Next)
- Automatic rate lookup per project
- Offline timer capability
- Export to CSV for accounting software

### COULD HAVE (Build if Capacity)
- Team collaboration features
- Receipt photo attachment
- Geolocation tagging

### WON'T HAVE (Out of Scope)
- Full accounting software features
- Multi-currency support (v1)

---

## Success Metrics

- Users can track time in under 10 seconds
- Invoices generated in under 2 minutes
- 80% of users create invoices weekly
- 4.5+ star rating after 30 reviews

---

## Business Case

**Development Cost**: ~80 hours
**ROI**: User saves 2 hours/week × $75/hr = $150/week = $7,800/year per user

---

## Competitive Context

- Toggl: Full-featured, expensive ($20/user/month)
- Harvest: Project management integration, complex UI
- Our advantage: Simple, mobile-first, offline-capable

---

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Users forget to stop timer | Auto-stop after 8 hours |
| Offline sync conflicts | Last-write-wins strategy |
| Privacy concerns with location | Make location optional, no server storage |

---

## Next Steps

1. Create epic: `/epic EP-0001 TITLE="Mobile Time Tracking MVP"`
2. Decompose into stories: Payment, Timer, Export
3. Start development sprint

```

## Next Steps After Brief Generation

After the brief is created, you'll see options:

- **Create Epic** - Convert brief directly to epic: `/epic EP-0001 TITLE="..." GOAL=...`
- **Refine Brief** - Make adjustments (personas, features, metrics) and regenerate
- **Done** - Brief is ready, decompose into stories manually

## Best Practices

### 1. Validate with Research

Always include research findings for better feature prioritization:

```bash
/research:ask TOPIC="Mobile time tracking market"
/research:import TOPIC="..."
/ideate:brief TOPIC="..." RESEARCH=docs/10-research/...
```

### 2. Bridge from Multiple Experts

Combine ideation from different domains:

```bash
/ideate:new SCOPE=security DEPTH=deep OUTPUT=report
/ideate:new SCOPE=ux DEPTH=deep OUTPUT=report
/ideate:brief TOPIC="..." IDEATION=docs/08-project/ideation/ideation-security.md,docs/08-project/ideation/ideation-ux.md
```

### 3. Iterate on the Brief

Briefs aren't final—they're living documents:

```bash
# Generate initial brief
/ideate:brief TOPIC="..." IDEATION=...

# Review and improve based on feedback
# Edit docs/08-project/briefs/...

# Create epic when ready
/epic EP-0001 TITLE="..." RESEARCH=docs/08-project/briefs/...
```

### 4. Use MoSCoW for Release Planning

```
MVP Release 1: MUST HAVE features
Release 2: SHOULD HAVE features
Release 3+: COULD HAVE features
```
