```

## The 9 Checks

| # | Check | Severity | Pass Criteria |
|---|-------|----------|---------------|
| LI-1 | Insight Tag installed | CRITICAL | LinkedIn Insight Tag on all pages |
| LI-2 | Lead Gen Forms vs landing | HIGH | Lead Gen Forms tested (typically 2-5x better CVR) |
| LI-3 | Audience size appropriate | HIGH | 50K-500K for Sponsored Content |
| LI-4 | Targeting precision | HIGH | By job title or function, not just industry |
| LI-5 | Budget minimum met | CRITICAL | Minimum $50/day per campaign |
| LI-6 | CRM integration | HIGH | Leads syncing to CRM within 24 hours |
| LI-7 | Content type mix | MEDIUM | Single image + carousel + video tested |
| LI-8 | Matched Audiences | MEDIUM | Website retargeting + company list + LAL active |
| LI-9 | ABM alignment | LOW | Account-Based Marketing lists for enterprise |

## Output

You receive:
- **LinkedIn Score** (0-100)
- **Check results** - Pass/fail for all 9 checks

## Account Data Needed

Provide details about your LinkedIn Ads:
- Insight Tag installation status
- Campaign objectives and budget
- Audience targeting (industry, job title, company size)
- Lead Gen Form usage vs landing page
- CRM integration status
- Content types tested (image, carousel, video)
- Performance metrics

Example format:
```
LinkedIn Ads Setup
- Campaigns: 3 (lead gen focus)
- Daily budget: $100/campaign ($300 total)
- Audience: Job titles "Product Manager, VP Product"
- Using landing pages, no Lead Gen Forms
- No CRM integration set up
```

## LinkedIn-Specific Context

LinkedIn has unique characteristics that matter for optimization:

**Budget Reality**:
- CPCs: $5-15 for Sponsored Content
- At $50/day minimum: ~3-10 clicks/day
- Monthly: ~100-300 clicks
- At 5% conversion rate: ~5-15 leads/month
- **Minimum viable budget for lead gen: $100/day recommended**

**Lead Gen Forms vs Landing Pages**:
- Lead Gen Forms: 10-30% conversion rate (pre-filled data)
- Landing Pages: 2-5% conversion rate
- **Always test Lead Gen Forms first on LinkedIn**

**Audience Targeting**:
- Industry alone is too broad (millions of people)
- Always layer with job title or function
- Company size matters (Enterprise vs SMB)
- Seniority levels (Director+) vs individual contributors

## Example Usage

### Basic Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:linkedin "LinkedIn: 3 campaigns, $50/day each. Using Lead Gen Forms. Job title targeting: 'VP Sales', 'Sales Director'. No CRM integration yet."
# Returns: LinkedIn Score with key recommendations
```

### Detailed Audit
```bash
/agileflow:ads:linkedin
# Paste detailed account setup and performance metrics
# Returns: Full 9-check audit with recommendations
```

## Expected Improvements

By implementing recommendations:
- **2-3x improvement** in conversion rate using Lead Gen Forms vs landing pages
- **15-25% improvement** in conversion rate with tighter audience targeting
- **Automatic lead routing** through CRM integration
- **Better ABM results** with company-targeted campaigns

## LinkedIn Best Practices

### Lead Gen Forms (Recommended)
- LinkedIn pre-fills with profile data (first name, email, company)
- Conversion rate 10-30% vs 2-5% for landing pages
- Form abandonment much lower
- Data quality excellent (LinkedIn verified)
- Lead time-to-CRM: minutes vs hours for landing pages

### Content Types
- **Single Image**: Highest CTR, lowest engagement
- **Carousel**: Good engagement, good form fills
- **Video**: Highest engagement, good CTR

### Audience Targeting Best Practices
- Always combine industry + job title (not just one)
- Start with 50K-500K audience size (not smaller)
- Test Lookalike audiences from customer list
- Layer with company targeting for B2B
- Matched audiences work well for retargeting

### CRM Integration
- Leads should sync within minutes, not hours
- Zapier if native integration not available
- Real-time sync prevents manual export
- Enables lead scoring and nurturing

## Tips

- **Lead Gen Forms > Landing Pages** - Always test Lead Gen Forms first
- **Audience precision matters** - LinkedIn is expensive, target tightly
- **Budget for 2-4 weeks ramp** - Need data before scaling
- **Test content types** - Video often performs best but takes more effort
- **CRM integration mandatory** - Leads are only valuable if they reach sales
