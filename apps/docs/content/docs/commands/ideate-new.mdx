# /ideate:new

Deploy multiple domain experts in parallel to analyze your codebase and generate categorized improvement ideas with confidence scoring.

## Quick Start

```bash
/agileflow:ideate:new
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SCOPE=all\|security\|perf\|code\|ux` | Analysis scope (default: all) |
| `DEPTH=quick\|deep\|ultradeep` | Analysis depth |
| `OUTPUT=report\|stories\|both` | Output format (default: report) |
| `HISTORY=true\|false` | Check against past ideation reports |
| `FOCUS=IDEA-XXXX` | All experts analyze one recurring idea |

## How It Works

1. Deploys domain experts in parallel (security, performance, code quality, UX)
2. Each expert analyzes the codebase from their perspective
3. Results are synthesized with confidence scoring:
   - **quick/deep**: HIGH = 2+ experts agree
   - **ultradeep**: HIGH = 3+ experts agree
4. Checks ideation index for duplicates (NEW vs RECURRING vs IMPLEMENTED)
5. Categorizes by domain and estimates effort (High/Medium/Low)

## Focus Mode

Use `FOCUS=IDEA-XXXX` to have all experts analyze a specific recurring idea and generate an Implementation Brief.
