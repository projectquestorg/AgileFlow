# Features

AgileFlow includes powerful features to protect your codebase, automate workflows, and keep your team productive.

## Core Features

### Skills System

Create, manage, and continuously improve custom AI prompts that learn from your feedback.

- **Research-backed creation** - Generated from web docs, local documentation, and your codebase
- **Cookbook workflows** - Multiple use-case specific guides in a single skill
- **Self-improving** - Skills learn from your corrections and refine automatically
- **MCP integration** - Connect to Model Context Protocol servers for tool access
- **Team shareable** - Commit to git and share institutional knowledge

### Agent Expertise System

Enable self-improving agents that maintain domain knowledge and accelerate task execution.

- **Expertise files** - Agents maintain mental models of their domain
- **Three-step workflow** - Plan (with expertise) → Build → Self-Improve
- **Automatic learning** - Expertise updates as agents work and make changes
- **Validation & metrics** - Tools to ensure expertise stays accurate and current
- **Focused domains** - Specialized knowledge for database, API, UI, testing, CI/CD, and more

[Learn about Agent Expertise](/docs/features/agent-expertise-system)

### Agent Teams

Coordinate multiple domain experts to work together on complex multi-domain tasks using [Claude Code's native Agent Teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams).

- **Dual-mode architecture** - Native Agent Teams when enabled, subagent orchestrator as fallback
- **Team templates** - Predefined teams for fullstack, code-review, builder-validator, and code-logic
- **Quality gates** - Enforce tests, lint, types, and coverage before work is accepted
- **Task synchronization** - Bidirectional sync between Claude Code's task list and AgileFlow status
- **Auto-detection** - `/babysit` automatically suggests teams for multi-domain tasks

[Learn about Agent Teams](/docs/features/agent-teams)

### Parallel Sessions

Work on multiple features, bugs, or experiments simultaneously with isolated workspaces and boundary protection.

- **Git worktrees** - Each session gets its own directory and branch
- **Boundary protection** - Edit/Write hooks prevent accidental cross-session edits
- **Easy switching** - Use `/add-dir` to switch sessions in the same terminal
- **Session tracking** - AgileFlow tracks all sessions with status and activity
- **Independent context** - Each session maintains its own story and progress

## Automation & Execution

### Smart Detection

Contextual Feature Router that automatically recommends the right AgileFlow features at the right time.

- **42 feature detectors** - Analyze project signals and recommend relevant commands
- **Lifecycle-aware** - 5 workflow phases ensure recommendations match what you're doing
- **Script-based** - Deterministic detection, not LLM guesswork
- **Anti-repetition** - Tracks offered/used/skipped features to avoid nagging
- **Configurable** - Disable features, adjust thresholds, override priorities

[Learn about Smart Detection](/docs/features/smart-detect)

### Hooks System

Event-driven automation using Claude Code's official hooks for triggers and responses.

- **SessionStart hooks** - Run scripts when Claude Code starts
- **PreCompact hooks** - Preserve context during conversation compression
- **PreToolUse hooks** - Block dangerous commands before execution
- **Ready-to-use scripts** - Status line, auto-archival, context preservation

[Learn about Hooks System](/docs/features/hooks-system)

### Automations System

Schedule recurring tasks to run automatically without requiring a daemon.

- **No daemon required** - Runs during user sessions via SessionStart hook
- **Multiple schedule types** - Daily, weekly, monthly, or custom intervals
- **Preset automations** - Pre-built automation templates (changelog, CI summary, dependency audit)
- **Loop detection** - Prevents runaway automation chains
- **Timeout protection** - Built-in safeguards for stuck processes

### Loop Mode

Run Claude autonomously with continuous story execution until epic completion.

- **Autonomous story processing** - Claude works through an epic without manual intervention
- **Test-based verification** - Stories verified complete via test suite
- **Configurable limits** - Set max iterations and timeouts
- **Smart detection** - Auto-enabled for epics with clear acceptance criteria
- **Multi-mode support** - Normal (test-based), Visual (UI), or Coverage-focused modes

[Learn about Loop Mode](/docs/features/loop-mode)

### Visual Mode

Screenshot verification system for UI development with automated visual progress tracking.

- **Verified-prefix protocol** - Screenshots must be reviewed and renamed with `verified-` prefix
- **Integrated with Loop Mode** - Adds visual verification step in autonomous execution
- **Multiple states capture** - Test default, hover, disabled, and other UI states
- **Auto-cleanup** - Optional cleanup of verified screenshots after completion

[Learn about Visual Mode](/docs/features/visual-mode)

### Compact Context Preservation

Preserve critical agent knowledge and state during automatic context compaction.

- **Context-aware compaction** - Critical rules preserved when Claude Code compresses context
- **Priority-based preservation** - Critical agents always preserved
- **State continuity** - Current story, blockers, and progress maintained
- **Long conversation support** - Sustained agent focus over days of work
- **Zero-overhead** - Automatic, no manual configuration needed

## Decision Making & Analysis

### AI Council

Get balanced strategic perspectives on complex architectural and business decisions.

- **Three perspectives** - Optimist (opportunities), Advocate (risks), Analyst (trade-offs)
- **Parallel deliberation** - All three agents analyze simultaneously
- **Debate mode** - Multi-round deliberation where agents respond to each other
- **Consensus synthesis** - Final recommendation balancing all viewpoints

### Logic Audit

Find logic bugs with multi-agent specialized analyzers and consensus voting.

- **Five analyzer types** - Edge cases, invariants, control flow, type errors, race conditions
- **Parallel analysis** - All analyzers run simultaneously for efficiency
- **Confidence scoring** - CONFIRMED (2+ agree), LIKELY (evidence-based), INVESTIGATE
- **Actionable reports** - Prioritized findings with reproduction steps

### RLM (Recursive Language Models)

Analyze complex large documents without context bloat using virtualization.

- **Document virtualization** - Never loads full document into context
- **Programmatic search** - Use document-repl for targeted extraction
- **Multi-hop reasoning** - Support for cross-referenced content (contracts, specs)
- **Iteration limits** - Built-in budget constraints and iteration tracking

### Research Pipeline

Structured research workflow for gathering and synthesizing knowledge.

- **Research prompts** - Generate detailed 200+ line prompts for external AI tools
- **Import & organize** - Save research findings from external sources
- **Analysis** - Extract structured insights from research notes
- **Synthesis** - Combine multiple research sources into actionable conclusions

### API Server

REST API for external integrations and dashboard applications.

- **Read-only access** - Exposes state without mutations
- **Localhost-only** - Secure by default (127.0.0.1)
- **JSON endpoints** - Access sessions, status, tasks, and metrics
- **No daemon needed** - Starts and stops on demand

## Setup & Safety

### Configuration System

Unified system for managing hooks, safety features, and automation with preset profiles and individual feature control.

- **Hooks system** - Event-driven automation (SessionStart, PreCompact, Stop)
- **Status line** - Custom status bar in Claude Code
- **Archival** - Auto-manage status.json file size
- **CI/CD** - Automated testing with GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI
- **Attribution** - Control AI disclosure in git commits
- **And more** - PreCompact context, verification, token management

- **Damage Control** - Optional safety system for Claude Code
- **Dynamic content** - Commands and agents automatically injected on install
- **Multi-IDE support** - Use the same project across multiple IDEs

### Damage Control

Protect your codebase from destructive commands using PreToolUse hooks.

- **File access control** - Protect secrets, keys, and critical files
- **Customizable rules** - Add project-specific protection patterns
- **Ask-first mode** - Require confirmation for risky operations
