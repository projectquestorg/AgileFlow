# Skills System

The Skills system connects you with a curated marketplace of reusable AI skills. Browse skills matched to your tech stack, install them with a single command, and customize them with learnings that improve over time.

## Quick Start

Get recommendations based on your project:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:recommend
```

Install a skill:

```bash
npx skills add vercel/next-skills
```

See what you have installed:

```bash
/agileflow:skill:list
```

## How It Works

### Marketplace Discovery

AgileFlow includes a curated catalog of ~60 vetted skills across 6 categories:

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Frontend | 13 | React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Tailwind |
| Backend | 11 | GraphQL, Express, FastAPI, Node.js, Go |
| Database | 8 | Prisma, Supabase, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis |
| Testing | 10 | TDD, Jest, Playwright, Cypress, pytest, Vitest |
| DevOps | 9 | GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform |
| Security | 8 | OWASP, code review, auth patterns, validation |

### Smart Recommendations

When you run `/agileflow:skill:recommend`, AgileFlow:

1. **Detects your tech stack** from `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, and project files
2. **Matches against curated skills** by scoring tag overlap
3. **Filters out already-installed skills** from `.claude/skills/`
4. **Shows ranked results** with install commands

### Live Marketplace

For broader discovery beyond curated picks:

```bash
npx skills search react        # Search by keyword
npx skills find                # Browse full marketplace
```

## What Are Skills?

A **skill** is a structured prompt template that teaches Claude how to handle specific tasks in your project context. Skills are:

- **Community-built** - Created and maintained by the developer community on skills.sh
- **Self-improving** - Learn from your corrections via the learnings system
- **Cookbook-based** - Multiple use-case workflows in a single skill

### Skill Structure

Each installed skill contains:

```
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file with instructions and triggers
├── references.md         # Links to docs, code patterns
└── cookbook/             # Per-use-case workflows
    ├── use-case-1.md
    └── use-case-2.md
```

### How Skills Work

1. **Activation**: When you ask Claude about a topic matching a skill's triggers, the skill activates
2. **Execution**: Claude reads SKILL.md and follows the instructions
3. **Learning**: When you correct Claude, the skill learns your preferences
4. **Evolution**: Each correction updates the learnings file, making the skill smarter

## Installing Skills

### From Recommendations

```bash
/agileflow:skill:recommend
```

This shows matching skills with install commands. Copy and run:

```bash
npx skills add vercel/next-skills
```

### From Marketplace

Browse skills.sh directly:

```bash
npx skills search <keyword>
npx skills find
```

### Manual Import

Copy a skill directory to your skills folder:

```bash
cp -r /path/to/skill .claude/skills/
```

## The Learnings System

Skills can improve automatically through a learnings system:

```
.agileflow/skills/_learnings/
├── supabase-swift.yaml
├── api-client.yaml
└── react-components.yaml
```

### What Skills Learn

When you use a skill and correct Claude's output, the skill learns:

1. **Explicit corrections** - High confidence learnings from direct feedback
2. **Approved responses** - Medium confidence learnings from approvals
3. **Patterns** - Low confidence observations for review

### Learning File Format

Each skill has an optional learnings file at `.agileflow/skills/_learnings/<skill>.yaml`:

```yaml
skill: supabase-swift
version: 1
last_updated: 2025-01-08T10:30:00Z

preferences:
  code_style: "swift-concurrency"
  error_handling: "Result<T, Error>"

conventions:
  naming: "camelCase for variables, PascalCase for types"
  testing: "Unit tests required for all public APIs"

anti_patterns:
  - "Avoid callback patterns (use async/await instead)"
  - "Never hardcode API keys in code"

metadata:
  corrections_count: 12
  approvals_count: 8
```

### How Self-Improvement Works

**On invocation:**
1. Claude checks if a learnings file exists
2. Reads preferences, conventions, and anti-patterns
3. Applies them while executing the skill

**On correction:**
1. You provide feedback or correction
2. Claude extracts the signal (what to change)
3. Updates the learnings file
4. Next invocation uses the updated preferences

## Best Practices

### Choosing Skills

1. **Start with recommendations** - Run `/agileflow:skill:recommend` first
2. **Match your stack** - Skills work best when they match your actual technologies
3. **One domain per skill** - Focused skills are more effective than broad ones
4. **Check quality** - Review the skill's SKILL.md before using it extensively

### Maintaining Skills

1. **Review learnings** - Check what the skill learned from corrections
2. **Update references** - Keep documentation links current
3. **Archive unused skills** - Clean up skills you no longer use
4. **Share improvements** - Commit learnings to git for team consistency

## Sharing Skills

### Version Control

Commit skills and learnings to git:

```bash
git add .claude/skills/
git add .agileflow/skills/_learnings/
git commit -m "Add next-best-practices skill with learnings"
```

Team members automatically get the skill and learnings.

### Creating Custom Skills

You can create your own skills manually:

1. Create a directory in `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`
2. Add a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
3. Optionally add `references.md` and `cookbook/` entries
4. The skill will appear in `/agileflow:skill:list`

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating

1. Check the "When to Use" section in SKILL.md
2. Make sure your question matches the activation triggers
3. Edit the skill to add more keywords if needed

### Learnings File Missing

1. Create the learnings file at `.agileflow/skills/_learnings/<skill>.yaml`
2. Future corrections will be tracked automatically
