# Tmux Keybindings

When you start Claude Code with the `af` command, AgileFlow creates a tmux session with preconfigured keybindings. All shortcuts use **Alt** (Option on Mac) as the modifier key.

## Quick Reference

### Essential (shown in status bar)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Alt+1** through **Alt+9** | Switch to window 1-9 |
| **Alt+s** | New Claude session (same directory) |
| **Alt+q** | Detach (leave session running in background) |

### Windows

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Alt+c** | Create new empty window |
| **Alt+n** | Next window |
| **Alt+p** | Previous window |
| **Alt+r** | Rename current window |
| **Alt+w** | Close window (with confirmation) |

### Panes

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Alt+d** | Split horizontally (side by side) |
| **Alt+v** | Split vertically (top/bottom) |
| **Alt+Arrow** | Navigate between panes |
| **Alt+z** | Zoom/unzoom pane (fullscreen toggle) |
| **Alt+x** | Close pane (with confirmation) |

### Utility

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Alt+k** | Interrupt (sends Ctrl+C twice, useful for frozen processes) |
| **Alt+[** | Enter copy/scroll mode |

## Status Bar

The tmux status bar has two lines:

**Top line**: Project name, git branch, and keybinding hints

**Bottom line**: Window tabs with the active window highlighted in orange

## Reattaching to a Session

If you detach with **Alt+q** or close your terminal, the session keeps running. To reattach:

```bash
af
```

AgileFlow automatically detects existing sessions for the current directory and reattaches.

## Mac Users

On macOS, **Alt** is the **Option** key. If Alt keybindings don't work, check your terminal settings:

- **iTerm2**: Preferences > Profiles > Keys > Left Option key > set to "Esc+"
- **Terminal.app**: Preferences > Profiles > Keyboard > check "Use Option as Meta key"
- **Alacritty / Kitty / WezTerm**: Usually works out of the box
