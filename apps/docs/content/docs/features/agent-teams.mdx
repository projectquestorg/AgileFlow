# Agent Teams

AgileFlow integrates with [Claude Code's native Agent Teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) to coordinate multiple specialized agents working together on complex tasks. A team lead orchestrates domain experts (API, UI, testing, security) who work in parallel with shared task lists, inter-agent messaging, and quality gates.

When Agent Teams isn't available, AgileFlow falls back to its subagent orchestrator model, producing the same results through a different execution mechanism.

## How It Works

AgileFlow wraps Claude Code's Agent Teams with project-aware coordination:

1. **You start a team** from a predefined template (or the `/babysit` mentor auto-detects when a team is needed)
2. **A team lead** spawns specialized teammates, each running as an independent Claude Code session
3. **Teammates work in parallel** on their assigned domain (backend, frontend, testing, etc.)
4. **Quality gates** enforce standards (tests pass, no lint errors, no type errors) before work is accepted
5. **Task synchronization** keeps AgileFlow's `status.json` in sync with Claude Code's native task list
6. **A messaging bridge** translates between AgileFlow's internal bus and Claude Code's inter-agent messaging

## Dual-Mode Architecture

AgileFlow supports two execution modes. Both produce the same results:

### Native Agent Teams Mode (Recommended)

When `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` is enabled, teammates run as fully independent Claude Code sessions:

```
Team Lead (delegate mode - coordinates only, no direct implementation)
  |-- Teammate A (independent session, file-locked)
  |-- Teammate B (independent session, file-locked)
  |-- Teammate C (independent session, file-locked)
  |-- Shared task list (~/.claude/tasks/)
```

**Advantages:**
- Each teammate has its own context window (no context bloat)
- File-locking prevents concurrent modification conflicts
- Teammates can message each other directly
- Better for long-running, complex work

### Subagent Orchestrator Mode (Fallback)

When Agent Teams is not enabled, AgileFlow uses its built-in orchestrator with subagents:

```
Orchestrator (coordinates via Task tool)
  |-- Task -> Expert A (within shared context)
  |-- Task -> Expert B (within shared context)
  |-- Task -> Expert C (within shared context)
  |-- AgileFlow bus messaging (docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl)
```

**Advantages:**
- Works in any environment (no experimental flag needed)
- Lower token cost (results summarized back to orchestrator)
- Simpler debugging (everything in one session)
- Better for short, focused tasks

## Getting Started

### Enable Agent Teams

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
```

Or add to your Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

### Start a Team

```
/agileflow:team:start fullstack
```

### Check Available Templates

```
/agileflow:team:list
```

### Monitor Team Status

```
/agileflow:team:status
```

### Stop a Team

```
/agileflow:team:stop
```

## Team Templates

AgileFlow includes 4 predefined team templates for common development patterns:

### fullstack

Full-stack feature development with integrated testing.

| Role | Agent | Domain |
|------|-------|--------|
| Lead | `team-lead` (delegate mode) | Coordination |
| Builder | `agileflow-api` | Backend |
| Builder | `agileflow-ui` | Frontend |
| Validator | `agileflow-testing` | Quality |

**Best for:** Building features that span backend and frontend with automated testing.

### code-review

Comprehensive code review from multiple quality perspectives.

| Role | Agent | Domain |
|------|-------|--------|
| Lead | `team-lead` (delegate mode) | Coordination |
| Reviewer | `code-reviewer` | Code quality |
| Reviewer | `agileflow-security` | Security |
| Reviewer | `agileflow-performance` | Performance |

**Best for:** Thorough code reviews where security, performance, and general quality are all important.

### builder-validator

Paired builders and validators for high-confidence implementations.

| Role | Agent | Domain |
|------|-------|--------|
| Lead | `team-lead` (delegate mode) | Coordination |
| Builder | `agileflow-api` | Backend |
| Validator | `agileflow-api-validator` | Backend validation |
| Builder | `agileflow-ui` | Frontend |
| Validator | `agileflow-ui-validator` | Frontend validation |

**Best for:** Critical features where every implementation must be independently verified.

### code-logic

Deep analysis of complex logic with multiple specialized analyzers.

| Role | Agent | Domain |
|------|-------|--------|
| Lead | `logic-consensus` | Consensus voting |
| Analyzer | `logic-analyzer-edge` | Boundary conditions |
| Analyzer | `logic-analyzer-flow` | Control flow |
| Analyzer | `logic-analyzer-invariant` | State consistency |
| Analyzer | `logic-analyzer-race` | Concurrency |
| Analyzer | `logic-analyzer-type` | Type safety |

**Best for:** Finding bugs in complex algorithms, async code, or critical business logic.

### Custom Templates

Create your own templates in `.agileflow/teams/<name>.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-team",
  "description": "Custom team for my project",
  "lead": {
    "agent": "team-lead",
    "delegate_mode": true,
    "plan_approval": true
  },
  "teammates": [
    {
      "agent": "agileflow-api",
      "role": "builder",
      "domain": "backend",
      "description": "Implements API endpoints"
    },
    {
      "agent": "agileflow-testing",
      "role": "validator",
      "domain": "quality",
      "description": "Validates implementations"
    }
  ],
  "quality_gates": {
    "teammate_idle": { "tests": true, "lint": true, "types": false },
    "task_completed": { "require_validator_approval": false }
  }
}
```

## Quality Gates

Quality gates enforce standards automatically via Claude Code hooks. They prevent incomplete or broken code from being accepted.

### TeammateIdle Gate

Runs when a teammate finishes work and is about to go idle.

- **Script:** `scripts/teammate-idle-gate.js`
- **Exit 0:** Allow teammate to go idle (work accepted)
- **Exit 2:** Block idle, display failures (teammate must fix issues)

**Checks:** Tests passing, lint passing, type checking, code coverage threshold.

### TaskCompleted Gate

Runs when a builder marks a task as complete.

- **Script:** `scripts/task-completed-gate.js`
- **Exit 0:** Allow task completion
- **Exit 2:** Block completion until validator approves

**Checks:** Validator approval (for builder-validator teams), test coverage threshold.

### Configuration

Configure quality gates via `/agileflow:configure` or directly in your config:

```yaml
quality_gates:
  teammate_idle:
    tests: required
    lint: required
    types: optional
    coverage: 75
  task_completed:
    validator_approval: required
    test_coverage: 80
```

## Task Synchronization

Tasks are bidirectionally synchronized between two systems:

| System | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Native Task List** | `~/.claude/tasks/` | Source of truth for teammates during active work |
| **AgileFlow Status** | `docs/09-agents/status.json` | Persistent project state and historical record |

When a teammate completes a task, the result syncs to `status.json`. When the team shuts down, all final states reconcile back to AgileFlow's status tracking.

## Messaging Bridge

The messaging bridge (`scripts/messaging-bridge.js`) translates between:

- **AgileFlow bus** (`docs/09-agents/bus/log.jsonl`) - internal message logging
- **Claude Code inter-agent messaging** - native teammate communication

All messages flow through both systems, giving you full observability regardless of which mode you're using.

## Integration with /babysit

The `/babysit` mentor deeply integrates with Agent Teams, automatically detecting when a team is needed and managing the full lifecycle.

### Smart Detection

During its initial context gathering phase, `/babysit` checks for team mode signals:

| Signal | Detection | Template Selected |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` is set | Teams mode available | - |
| Epic has stories with different owners (AG-API + AG-UI) | Multi-domain task | `fullstack` |
| Task description mentions multiple domains | Cross-layer work | `fullstack` |
| Security review requested or pre-release | Security audit needed | `code-review` |
| High-confidence implementation required | Critical feature | `builder-validator` |

When detected, babysit reports:

```
Smart Detection Results:
  Team Mode: ENABLED (epic has AG-API + AG-UI stories)
  Template: fullstack (auto-selected)
```

### How Babysit Delegates to Teams

When team mode is active, `/babysit` changes its delegation behavior:

1. **Without teams**: Babysit spawns individual domain experts via the Task tool for each piece of work
2. **With teams**: Babysit starts a team via `/team:start` and the team lead coordinates all teammates in parallel

This means multi-domain stories that would normally require sequential expert spawning (API first, then UI, then testing) can run **all three teammates simultaneously** with file-locking preventing conflicts.

### Task Registry Integration

Babysit tracks team tasks through AgileFlow's task registry:

1. **Before spawning**: Checks for running duplicates to avoid conflicts
2. **During work**: Registers tasks with story IDs for traceability
3. **On completion**: Marks tasks complete and triggers validator chains (for builder-validator teams)
4. **Quality gates**: Enforces test/lint/type checks before accepting teammate output

### Override

If babysit auto-detects team mode but you prefer individual expert delegation:

```bash
/agileflow:babysit TEAM=false
```

Or say "no teams" in your initial message to babysit.

## When to Use Agent Teams vs Subagents

| Use Agent Teams when... | Use Subagents when... |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Task spans multiple domains | Task is focused on one domain |
| Teammates need to communicate | Only the result matters |
| Work will be long-running | Work is quick and focused |
| You need file-locking | No concurrent file edits |
| You want independent context per agent | You prefer everything in one session |
